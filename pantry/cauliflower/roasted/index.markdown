# Roasted Cauliflower

Roasting cauliflower is an easy way to get the most flavor out of your
veggies. Tossed with a bit of flavorful oil and some herbs and spices,
and you've got a quick addition to any meal.

## You Will Need

* 1 head cauliflower
* 1 baking sheet
* Oven

### Optional Additions

* Extra-virgin olive oil
* Red pepper
* Black pepper
* Salt
* Thyme
* Rosemary
* Garlic
* Parmesan

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450°. Remove leaves from around cauliflower, then
carefully cut the florets from the stalk. Chop the florets into
even-sized pieces. Coat lightly with olive oil and sprinkle herbs and
spices, tossing to ensure even coating. Arrange in single layer on
baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes or until tender and turning golden.
Let cool and serve.

## Details

This can be done with simply some salt and pepper, or you can add some
herbs like thyme, parsley, sage, chives, or rosemary.

Here, I've used black pepper, red pepper, and thyme.

Cauliflower, like broccoli, is actually from the same species as
cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts: [Brassica
oleracea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea). Unlike most
of those, in this case, we want to remove the leaves.

Turn the cauliflower over. The leaves can be simply pulled away from the
stalk to reveal the inside branches of the florets.

With the leaves removed, we can now carefully cut the florets from the
stalk. Once the floret is removed from the stalk, you can cut off some
of the branch stem if it's too thick and woody.

Now that the stalk is cleaned, we need to chop the cauliflower into
approximately equal pieces. This will ensure that they cook evenly and
are all done at the same time.

With that done, we can lay the florets on a baking pan. Keep them in
a single layer to ensure even cooking.

Now we can add the oil, spices, and herbs. You could do this in a bowl,
but I just tossed it all on the baking sheet.

And then I mixed it all together with my hands to ensure an even coating
of oil and spices. Learning how to cook has done wonders for my fear of
getting dirty.

Now it's ready to slide into our 450° oven. The high temperature will
ensure browning, and browning equals flavor.
