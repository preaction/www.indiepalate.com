title: Slow Cooker BBQ Ribs
---

It's been quite a while since [the last time I made beef spare
ribs](/blog/2015/08/02/dry-rubbed-oven-spare-ribs). This time, I tried
using the slow cooker instead. This time, I used [this slow cooker BBQ
short ribs recipe from
Flavorite](http://flavorite.net/2016/02/06/slow-cooker-bbq-short-ribs/).
It was easy, and pretty good, but I think the oven worked a lot better.

That is not to say these were bad. They were still tasty. The BBQ sauce
was the main flavor, as expected. The mushroom risotto I made to go with
worked perfectly. Some [fresh green beans](/pantry/green-beans) played
the part of vegetable.

But in the end it was a lot of waiting for not a lot of return. I think
I'll try something different next time.
