title: Lemon Poppyseed Muffins
---

With my success with [Blueberry muffins](/recipe/2015/10/24/blueberry-muffins),
and my [love of]() [all things]() [lemon](/recipe/tag/lemon) I decided to try
my hand at some lemon poppyseed muffins.

Remember most of the lemon flavor is in the zest, so you'll want to get all
that lemony goodness.

They're nothing to write home about. I think a nice sugar topping would save
the day (just sprinkle some sugar on top before baking), or perhaps some icing
(mix powdered sugar and water in a bowl and drizzle on after baking).
