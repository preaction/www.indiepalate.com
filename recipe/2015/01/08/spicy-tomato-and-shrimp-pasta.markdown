title: Spicy Tomato and Shrimp Pasta

I've been trying a bunch of [Budget Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com) recipes
recently, and liking them. This one is no exception: [Spicy Tomato and Shrimp
Pasta](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/07/spicy-shrimp-tomato-pasta/)

I didn't read the instructions right, and accidentally bought half as much
tomatoes as I needed. Budget Bytes's recipes seem to run small. Whereas I
normally make enough for a family and then have leftovers for a couple days.
But, surprisingly, it still turned out pretty well even with half the amount of
tomatoes.

## Ingredients

* 16 oz. fettuccine
* 4 Tbsp olive oil
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 6 cloves garlic
* 1 lb. peeled & deveined shrimp (41/50 size)
* 1 (30. oz.) can diced tomatoes
* 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* Parsley

## Instructions

Mince the garlic cloves. Rinse the shrimp under cool water (you can thaw it by
running it under cool water for a few minutes).

Start boiling the water to cook the pasta according to the direction.

While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil and butter to a large skillet and
place over medium heat.

Once the butter is melted, add the shrimp and garlic. Saute the shrimp for 3-5
minutes or until the shrimp turns a solid white-pink. Remove the shrimp with a
spatula (keeping the liquids in the pan) and set aside.

Add the can of tomatoes with juices to the skillet, along with the red and
black pepper and salt. Stir to combine and let the sauce simmer over medium
heat for about five minutes.

When the sauce has thickened slightly, add the cooked and drained pasta. Toss
to coat in the sauce. Add the cooked shrimp back to the skillet and toss to
combine with the pasta. Taste and adjust the salt if needed.

Sprinkle parsley on top.
