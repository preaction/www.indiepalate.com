title: Lemon Cream Cheese Crumb Cake
---

I love lemon. Love it.

This has a bunch of steps, and requires a bunch of bowls (reuse seems to be
fine), but it comes together pretty easily. The middle layer is a bit delicate,
but don't worry too much about it.

It can be hard to see "golden" crumb when it's inside the oven. Take care the
cream cheese filling doesn't get too dark.

This is very much a coffee cake. The streusel crumbs, the moist crumb, the
cream cheese bit, all comes together for a nice morning treat.
