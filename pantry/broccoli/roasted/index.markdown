# Roasted Broccoli

Roasting broccoli is a hassle-free way to prepare broccoli, if you've
got some extra time in the rest of your meal. Tossing it with some
flavorful oil, herbs, and spices makes it even better.

## You Will Need

* 1-2 Broccoli stalks
* 1 Baking Sheet
* Oven

### Optional Additions

* Extra-virgin olive oil
* Black pepper
* Salt
* Thyme
* Oregano
* Garlic

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425Â°. Rinse broccoli well, then carefully remove the
florets from the stalk. Chop the florets into even-sized pieces. Coat
lightly with oil and seasoning, tossing to ensure even coating. Arrange
in single layer on baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes or until tender and
just browning. Let cool and serve.

## Details

![Ingredients for roasted broccoli](01-ingredients.jpg)

Roasting broccoli can be done with just some salt and pepper, or you can
add some herbs. I used an Italian seasoning medley, but just some thyme
and oregano will work fine.

Rinse the broccoli well. Then, turn the broccoli over and begin cutting
the florets from the stalk. You can get some of the stems as well, but
avoid the main stalk, as it will be woody.

Once all the florets are removed, chop them up into approximately
even-sized pieces. This will ensure even cooking.

Putting the florets in a bowl will make it easier to coat them in oil,
herbs, and spices.

Add the oil and any herbs and spices you want and mix well.

Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet in a single layer, and then toss
it in the oven.

After about 20 minutes, the broccoli should be tender and just starting
to brown. Once it's done, remove from the heat, let cool a bit, and
serve.
