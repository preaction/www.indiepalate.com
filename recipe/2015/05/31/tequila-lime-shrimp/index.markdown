title: Tequila Lime Shrimp
---

I don't remember where I found this recipe, but it's crazy delicious. Tequila,
lime, and salty, buttery shrimp combine together so well. This stuff is great
with rice or on a tortilla with cheese and sour cream.

There is a lot of butter here, but don't shrimp out on it. It all condenses
down into a tasty sauce for the shrimp.

A remember to keep frozen shrimp frozen until you're about to use them. Then,
thaw them under warm, running water.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup butter
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped (or some garlic powder)
* 1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined
* 4 tablespoons tequila
* 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
* Cilantro to taste

## Instructions

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic; cook and
stir for about 30 seconds. Add shrimp; cook until they start to turn pink,
about 3 minutes. Pour in the tequila and lime juice and season with salt and
chili powder. Simmer until the liquid has evaporated, about 3 more minutes.
Pour shrimps on a plate and garnish with cilantro.

Thawing the shrimp is the longest, hardest part of this recipe. Keep the water
running until they're completely thawed.

Once they're thawed, you can remove the shell by pinching hard here, right at
the joint, and pulling. It should get all the meat from inside the shell, but
if you don't, don't worry too much about it.

When melted, add the shrimp.

The shrimp is done when they turn opaque and slightly smaller. Don't worry
about undercooking here, because they're going to be in a lot longer. In fact,
undercooking at this stage is a good idea.

Add the tequila, lime juice, and seasonings.

Usually, I just eat this with some rice. But, this time I decided to try making
a burrito. It was amazing.

Cheese and sour cream added some creaminess without masking the flavor of the shrimp.
I'd avoid salsa.
