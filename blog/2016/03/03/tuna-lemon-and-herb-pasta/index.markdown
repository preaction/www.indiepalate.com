title: Tuna Lemon and Herb Pasta

I love the versatility of pasta. With just a few pantry ingredients, you
can make a delicious meal. [This Tuna Lemon and Dill recipe from Olive
Magazine](http://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/linguine-with-tuna-lemon-and-dill/3156.html)
is a perfect example.

I made some modifications due to the nature of US grocery stores and
Imperial units, and my appalling lack of fresh dill, to create a [Tuna
Lemon and Herb Pasta recipe](/recipe/tuna-lemon-and-herb-pasta).
