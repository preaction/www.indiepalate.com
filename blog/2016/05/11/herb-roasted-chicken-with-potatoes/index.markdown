title: Herb Roasted Chicken with Potatoes
---

I'm clearing out the chicken from my freezer, which means finding at
least a couple new ways to do it. Unlike [last week's chicken
parmesan](/blog/2016/05/04/chicken-parmesan), which I've made dozens of
times, this week, I found [this recipe for Herb Roasted Chicken with
Potatoes from
SimplyRecipes](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/herb_roasted_chicken_thighs_with_potatoes/).

I've seen recipes like this before, simply tossing some chicken on top
of some veggies and shoving it in the oven for an hour, but this is the
first one I've ever tried. It turned out pretty well, all things
considered, and I was pleased at how easy it was.

I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I substituted an equal amount of
balsamic. The shallots I replaced with small yellow onions, and I ran
out of fresh garlic, so I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (1/8 tsp powder
per clove).

All told this is a great, easy, inexpensive dinner, and you can vary the
herbs and sauce for infinite possibilities. Something hot and spicy
sounds good, or a heaping helping of your favorite seasoned salt.

Next time, I might try a different cut of meat. Thighs and legs might
not be the right cut of meat to use, due to their higher fat content.
Roasting the chicken on the potatoes means the fat can't drain away.
