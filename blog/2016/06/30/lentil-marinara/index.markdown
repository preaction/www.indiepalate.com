I'd never tried lentils before, which is a shame because they're great.
Easy to make and nutritious, lentils are a good staple to have in your
pantry. They're like dried beans, without the lengthy overnight soaking
before use.

Since I also had a bunch of tomato sauce makings about, I decided to see
if they could be combined. I had previously made a red bean and tomato
sauce recipe, but beans are large and chewy, and the end result was
unappetizing at best.

However, adding 1 cup of red lentils to [my tomato sauce
recipe](/recipe/tomato-sauce) turned out wonderfully. I just added the
lentils immediately after everything else, and let the whole thing
simmer for 25 minutes until the lentils were tender. The lentils added
some flavor and a bunch of protein, so it's a good option for
vegetarians (the parmesan cheese I added stopped it from being vegan).
Added together with some [roasted broccoli](/pantry/broccoli/roasted)
and I had a nice, healthy meal.
