Shrimp is my favorite seafood. My favorite meat, even. If it weren't
always so damned expensive where I live, I'd eat shrimp all the time.

[This recipe for Shrip Etouffee](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/shrimp_etouffee/),
a spicy Cajun shrimp dish, is easy and delicious. I made my own shrimp
stock (included in the recipe), so it took a little longer, but even
that was pretty easy. I wonder if what I consider easy has changed over
the course of this blog...

I didn't have any Cajun seasoning, but I did have some Chipotle
seasoning, which lended a nice, smokey flavor. Altogether, the spices
and hot sauce made for a good kick and great flavor.
