Risotto seems like one of those recipes that can soak up pantry
ingredients. Here's some leftover shrimp and cheese I had laying around,
along with an onion and some garlic. I've been keeping a good stock of
broths on-hand, and the standard grains like rice.

Start by melting the butter in a medium saucepan set to medium heat.

Once the butter is melted...

![Saucepan on a stove with onion cooking in melted butter](04-onion-started.jpg)

We can start the onion. We want it to sweat so we get the flavor, but we
don't want it to brown, so keep the heat low.

Once the onion is tender, and maybe a little brown on the edges...

![Raw white rice in saucepan with onion](06-rice-added.jpg)

We can add the rice, and mix things up a bit. Keep stirring the rice for
a couple minutes, until it gets a slight golden color (about a minute).

Once the rice is a bit golden, add the wine and cook for just a little
bit until it mostly evaporates (less than a minute).

![Small amount of broth added to saucepan with rice and onion](08-broth-start.jpg)

Then, we can start adding the broth, about 1/2 cup at a time. Keep the heat on
medium here, and keep stirring until the liquid thickens or evaporates.

Once the liquid thickens, add another 1/2 cup.

And repeat this...

And keep going...

Until all the broth is used. The pot should never get dry, and if you
add too much it's better than adding too little. The end result should
be thick and creamy.

Now we can add the parsley, salt, and pepper to taste.

![Shrimp added to saucepan](14-shrimp.jpg)

Then the shrimp to warm up (yes that's a little freezer burn and
I should've thrown that one away).

And finally the cheese.

Mix it all together, and it's done!
