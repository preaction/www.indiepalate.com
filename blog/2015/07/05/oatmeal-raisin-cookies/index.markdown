title: Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies
---

I should just go ahead and call this a cookie blog at this point. I really felt
like some oatmeal cookies, and the raisins were just a nice touch.

I tried without the raisins, and though they are optional, they really add
tartness and flavor to the cookies. Dried cranberries are a good substitute,
but they need something in them, or else it's just oatmeal.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 c butter, softened
* 1 c brown sugar
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp cloves
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 3/4 c flour
* 2 cups quick oats
* 1 c raisins

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 325Â°.

In mixing bowl, beat butter for 30 seconds on high. Add brown sugar and
granulated sugar and mix for another 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the
bowl. Add spices and combine.

Add eggs and vanilla, mix until combined. Mix the flour in slowly, then add
the oats. Finally, add the raisins, mixing thoroughly.

Spoon 1" round pieces of dough onto cookie sheet, about 2" apart. Bake for
8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Cool on wire racks.

Like all good cookies, these start with butter. Stick it out for an hour or so to
be room temperature.

Then beat hell out of it until it's nice and creamy.

Add the sugar and mix it on high again. Scrape the sides here to make sure it's
all combined evenly.

The dough is incredibly sticky, thanks to the oatmeal. Using the spoons deftly will
keep your fingers clean.

The cookies are done with the edges are golden. They'll still cook when out of the
oven, so if they look done, they're really burnt.

Put them on wire racks to cool quickly to stop the baking.

All done! The cookies will keep in an airtight container for about a week.
