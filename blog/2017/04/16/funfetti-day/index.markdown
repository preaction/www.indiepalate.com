title: Funfetti Day

Despite spring allergies hitting me hard, I was able to go to the
grocery store, where I noticed Funfetti Cake Mix on sale for 99Â¢. Being
frugal, I picked up a couple to see what I could do with them.

I've had two recipes in [my Pinterest
account](https://www.pinterest.com/indiepalate/) for quite some time.
One is [a recipe for Funfetti cookies I've tried
before](http://cookiesandcups.com/funfetti-gooey-butter-cookies/), the
other [a recipe for funfetti puppy chow that sounded
interesting](http://deliciouslysprinkled.com/sugar-cookie-puppy-chow/).
Since the cookies have to chill for an hour, I had just enough time to
make the puppy chow!

They both turned out pretty well. I was skeptical about the puppy chow
at first, but I really like cake-flavored things (that aren't cake, for
some reason), and these two things definitely fit the bill!
