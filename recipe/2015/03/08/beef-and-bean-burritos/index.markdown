title: Beef and Bean Burritos

Tortillas are my favorite bread product, beating out pita, naan, biscuits, and
classic loaves. They are simple and versatile, can be served as any course
(including dessert), and the best part is, they come in sizes big enough for a
meal.

There is only one rule for a tortilla: Bigger is Better!

What's important is what goes _in_. Quick-service restaurants like Chipotle and
Q'Doba have turned burritos into a deli-style experience, letting you mix and
match flavor combinations forever.

The individual components made here can be substituted with other things,
allowing you to customize your burrito experience.

Just remember the one rule: Bigger is better!

## Ingredients

### Cilantro Lime Rice

* 2 c. water
* 1 c. white rice (uncooked)
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp cilantro leaves

### Spice Mix

* 1 Tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 Tbsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 Tbsp corn starch
* 1/3 c. water

(This is the same spice mix as used in [chili mac](/recipe/2015/02/15/chili-mac.html))

### Other Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 (16 oz) can black beans, drained

### Optional toppings

* Sour cream
* Cheese
* Refried beans
* Salsa
* Corn

## Instructions

As the first step, set up and measure all your ingredients and prepare the
spice mixture. Drain the black beans.

The rice takes approximately 20 minutes (15 after the water starts to boil), so
start the water boiling next. While that's happening, heat a pan over medium
heat and start browning the beef.

When the rice water comes to a boil, toss in the rice, cover, and quickly bring
to a boil again. After it starts boiling again, turn the heat down to low and
simmer for about 15 minutes. The rice is done when most of the liquid is
absorbed.

While waiting for the rice to cook, continue browning the beef. Drain, Add
spices and water. Simmer until thickened.

When the rice is done, add the lime juice and cilantro and fluff with a fork.

When everything is done, warm the tortillas to make them more pliable (20
seconds in the microwave works).

Prepare the spice mix first, to make it easy to add at the right time.

Next, the rice. Bring the water to a boil before adding the rice.

When all the liquid is evaporated (about 15 minutes), turn off the heat, fluff
with a fork, and add the mix-ins.

I like to put the beans with the rice, to make sure there's an even distribution
in the resulting burrito.

While the rice is cooking, the beef can be cooking too.

Remember to drain the fat before you add the spice mix!

And finally, we can assemble the burrito. These were some very good tortillas. Do
not skimp on the tortilla, or you'll have a mess on your hands, literally.

When closing the burrito, turn in the sides first.

Then fold the bottom over.

Then roll it all up.
