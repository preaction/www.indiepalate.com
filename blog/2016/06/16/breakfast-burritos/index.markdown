title: Breakfast Burritos
---

Over the last year and a half, I've been levelling up my basic cooking
skills, like sauteéing and improvising. So, since I had some tortillas
from [the chicken lunch wraps](/blog/2016/06/02/chicken-lunch-wraps),
and some mushrooms from last night's [chicken with white
wine](/blog/2016/02/24/poulet-au-vin-blanc/), I decided to try making
another breakfast burrito.

Unlike [the last breakfast
burrito](/blog/2015/07/26/simple-breakfast-burritos/), this one
had mushrooms and onions, and no rice. To get the most flavor possible,
I sauteéd the onions and mushrooms until golden brown and delicious.
Then, I turned off the burner, and with the remaining heat, scrambled the
eggs. I assembled the lot into a warm tortilla, and for a finishing
touch, added some salt, pepper, and tabasco.

I wish I could eat like this every morning. Having a nice, relaxing 30
minute, freshly-made breakfast. Maybe I need to start getting into the
habit...
