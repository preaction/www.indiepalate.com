# Apple Crisp

<small>Version 1 - 2017-06-15</small>

Apple crisp is a wonderful easy dessert to toss together. It's very
similar to an upside-down pie: The same ingredients and techniques are
used to create the crust.

This tastes best served immediately, but can also be covered and
refrigerated for up to a week. Serve warm with some ice cream or whipped
cream.

## Equipment

* 2 mixing bowls
* Pastry blender (or potato masher)
* 13x9" baking dish

## Ingredients

For the crust:

* 1 c flour
* 1 c sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 12 tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks)

For the filling:

* 8 granny smith apples
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp corn starch
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt

## Instructions

Pre-heat to 375Â°.

Mix together flour, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Mash in
butter until well-mixed and crumbly (like pie crust). Refrigerate this
mixture until later.

Dice apples and toss with sugar, corn starch, and salt. Spread out
evenly in the bottom of the 13x9 pan. Shake crust mixture over apples
and gently spread evenly over the apples. Do not pack down!

Bake for 45 minutes or until crust is dry and firm. Let cool for 15
minutes to firm up before serving.

This is an excellent recipe for getting rid of some apples: Everything
but the apples are things you likely already have in your pantry. Scale
it up or down as you like.

First, mix together the dry crust ingredients in a bowl.

Next, chop the butter up into the bowl. The butter needs to stay cold,
so do this part quickly.

Finally, mash the butter into the dry ingredients with the pastry
blender (or, as I've been using, a potato masher). The end result should
be crumbly, with the butter well-integrated into the dry mix. Again,
this needs to be done quickly so the butter doesn't melt.

Put this aside in the refrigerator until later while you chop the
apples.

The easiest way I've found to do this involves cutting from the top of
the apple down around the core.

Once the core is removed, you can slice across the large pieces and then
slice across once to create smaller chunks (approximately a dice, but it
doesn't have to be perfect).

Once the apples are all chopped, sprinkle with the sugar, corn starch,
and salt and toss to coat them evenly-ish.

Once coated, spread them evenly in the bottom of a 13x9 pan. The pan
does not need to be oiled or floured or prepared in any way.

Cover the apples with the crumbly crust mixture, gently spreading it
evenly over the apples. Do not press down or compact the crust: The
moisture needs to evaporate.

Put in oven for 45 minutes, or until the crust turns a bit darker,
looks dry, and is firm to the touch.

Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving with ice cream.
