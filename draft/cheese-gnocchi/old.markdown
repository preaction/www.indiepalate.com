I've made this quite a bit, because it's an easy way to get fresh pasta,
but I've never made it with [Cheddar Cheese sauce](). My usual
accompaniment is a [tomato sauce](), though I have also made [alfredo
sauce]() as well.

It takes about an hour to make, which isn't bad for a weeknight. But the
real beauty is making one, two, or three batches and freezing them for
quick meals. Gnocchi will keep for months in the freezer, and tastes
good either fresh or frozen.

This time I tried gnocchi with cheddar cheese sauce, and it was great.
The gnocchi was chewy and gave substance, and I used the sharpest
cheddar I could find for a good sauce.
