It's not all epic concoctions here. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for something
bad for me. But, even the bad food has good things to know.

Mac and Cheese was a special occasion growing up. I don't know if they put
crack in it, but there is something about the classic blue box that tastes
nostalgically better than all other Mac and Cheese.

But, eating just a box (or two) of Mac and Cheese just isn't enough adulting
for my taste. So, tonight, I spiced it up a bit with some spicy beef.

A good spice blend can be applied to a lot of things. So it is with this one,
which works well in Chili Mac, tacos, burritos, and goes well with chicken or
beef.

## Instructions

First, start preparing the mac and cheese noodles.

Combine the spice blend and set aside.

Next, brown the ground beef in a large pan. When the beef is browned, drain the fat

### Browning The Meat

First we brown the meat.

This is how much fat I drained. I made the mistake of not draining with
[lasagna](/blog/2015/02/07/classic-lasagna). I don't plan on making it
again...

Once the water is cooked away, the meat looks amazing.
