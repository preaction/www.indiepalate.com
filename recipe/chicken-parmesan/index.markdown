# Chicken Parmesan

Chicken Parmesan is one of my all-time favorite chicken dishes, since it
combines breaded chicken with spaghetti and tomato sauce, two great
tastes that taste great together, with a whole bunch of cheese.

You can use [my tomato sauce recipe](/recipe/tomato-sauce). Just start
the sauce before the chicken, and by the time the chicken is done and
resting, you can blend the sauce for serving.

Preheat oven to 425°. Mix bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and Italian
seasoning. Mix eggs until smooth. Drench chicken in egg and then cover

This recipe is why I always have something I can use for breading on
hand. Panko crumbs are nice, but crushed saltine crackers will do if
needed.

An Italian seasoning mix generally consists of basil, oregano, rosemary,
and thyme. If you've got those on-hand, you don't need to buy the
mixture. Just mix equal parts of those herbs (about 1 tsp each should
work).

First we get our breading ready. Measure out the ingredients and then
mix them together.

Put them on a plate or other wide, shallow container so its easy to get
the chicken in and out.

Next scramble the eggs. This bowl isn't ideal, as some of the chicken
parts are a bit too big, but it worked fine and still tastes that same.

Scramble the eggs by folding with a fork, or dirty a whisk if you'd
like.

Once we've got all our ingredients ready, we can begin the breading
process.

Coat the chicken in the eggs. Get all the bits covered, as this is the
only way the breading will stick.

Then roll the chicken in the breading. Pat the chicken in the crumbs
gently on every side. Pile crumbs on top and pat them down.

Try to get the chicken as thoroughly and evenly coated as you can.

Move the chicken pieces to a baking sheet.

I had thought I would have a lot of breading left, but it turns out most
of it was used.

After about 20-25 minutes, check on the chicken. Once the internal
temperature reaches 165°, you're done! Make sure to get your thermometer
deep into the middle of the thickest part, but don't hit bone or your
reading will be off.
