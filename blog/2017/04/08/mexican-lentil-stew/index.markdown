It's been quite a long time since I made a [Budget
Bytes](http://budgetbytes.com) recipe, but [this recipe for Mexican
Lentil Soup](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2009/12/mexican-lentil-stew/)
is one of my favorites. It's easy to make and packed with flavor.

I add a spoonful of sour cream to every bowl to really make it
delicious, and serve it with some cheese and crackers or grilled cheese.
