title: Skillet Chicken with Mustard Cream Sauce

This recipe had me at mustard and cream. I've been looking for simpler
dishes, something to put together quickly, and this turned out to be
perfect.

I adaped this recipe from [Cooking Classy's Skillet Chicken with Mustard
Cream
Sauce](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2015/02/skillet-chicken-with-mustard-cream-sauce/).
Because I didn't have any cream on hand, I went with whole milk and a
little bit of flour.

I did not do my mise en place, which really screwed me when having to
cook the asparagus. Remember to read the recipe beforehand!

I really want to try this sauce with other things. Beef and pork sound
like safe choices, but a fried or poached egg might be incredible.

For additions, I decided to try cooking asparagus for the first time,
which turned out really well. I also thought adding some fettucini would
work, but I wasn't that impressed. A little butter added to both did
wonders, though.

## Ingredients

* 4 (6 oz) boneless skinless chicken breasts
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/4 c chicken broth
* 1/2 c milk
* 1/2 tbsp flour
* 2 tbsp dijon mustard
* 1/2 tsp dried sage

## Instructions

Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Season chicken breasts with salt and
pepper. Fry chicken in skillet until cooked through, 5-6 minutes per
side. Remove from skillet.

Add garlic to pan and saute briefly until aromatic. Then add broth,
milk, flour, mustard, and sage. Cook, stirring constantly, until
thickened.

Always remember to do the prep work first. It makes everything go a lot
smoother.

We only need a single clove of garlic, so just mash it with the flat of
your knife, and then mince and set aside.

To prepare some asparagus, cut off the bottom, woody section.

Next, remove the excess white fat from the chicken breasts.

Since these were way too big, I sliced them in half to make them cook
faster and more evenly.

Cover the breasts in salt and pepper for taste.

Add the olive oil to a heated skillet.

Then add the chicken breasts.

After a few minutes, flip them over. Remember: Browning is flavor!

After a few more minutes, the chicken should be done. If you've got a
meat thermometer, the chicken should be 165Â°. Otherwise, if you cut it
open, it should be white, not pink.

Remove the breasts to a plate.

Collect the ingredients for the sauce.

First, fry the garlic a bit to release its flavor.

Next, add the milk and broth to deglaze the pan. Scrape up all the bits
of chicken that are stuck to the bottom to get more flavor.

Add the sage and the mustard.

And a little bit of flour.

To cook the asparagus, heat some olive oil in another skillet.

Pan fry them, stirring occasionally.

The asparagus is done when tender, and turns a rich green.

I decided to serve the chicken over fettucini, but that's not a
requirement.
