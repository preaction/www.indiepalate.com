# Cooking Rice on a Stove Top

Cooking rice on a stove top is easy to do, and only takes about 15
minutes. You can make any amount of rice that you want as long as you
keep the ratio of water to rice the same: 1 dry cup of white rice
requires 2 cups of water.

Note: These instructions are for plain, ordinary, white rice. Parboiled
(Minute) rice takes a lot less time, and comes with instructions on the
package. Brown (wild) rice takes more time, but still the same basic
technique here will work.

## Equipment

* Medium sauce pan with cover

## Ingredients

* 2 c water
* 1 c white rice (dry)

## Instructions

Boil water in the sauce pan. Add the rice, cover, and bring to boil
again. Turn heat to the lowest setting and simmer for 15 minutes, or
until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff rice with fork and let stand for
a few minutes before serving.

First, put the water in the pot and get it boiling. Covering the pot
will make it boil faster.

keep an eye on it so it doesn't boil over.
