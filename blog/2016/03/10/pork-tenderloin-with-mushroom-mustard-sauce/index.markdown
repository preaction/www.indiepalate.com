title: Pork Tenderloin with Mushroom Mustard Sauce
---

I've been eating way too much chicken lately. What can I say? It's
cheap, and so am I. But, I'm alive damnit, and I need to allow myself
to enjoy some finer things like a nice, expensive cut of meat once in
a while. Lucky for me, pork isn't that expensive. So I picked up a nice
pork tenderloin, and decided to try my hand at [this Pork Tenderloin
with Mushroom Sauce from
MyRecipes](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pork-tenderloin-mushroom-sauce).

I don't have a deep roasting pan, so instead I seared it in my big fry
pan (4 minutes per side), then stuck it on a sheet pan in a 375° oven
for 25 minutes while I sautéed the mushrooms and made the sauce. Instead
of chicken broth, I used some white wine, but by far the boldest flavor
in the sauce was the mustard.

Altogether, it was perhaps the tastiest thing I've ever cooked. Mustard
sauces are delicious, as I learned last year with
[Skillet Chicken with Mustard Sauce](/blog/2015/08/23/skillet-chicken-with-mustard-cream-sauce).
Though, the garlic basic couscous I made to accompany could use some
work...
