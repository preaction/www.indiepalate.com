title: Oven Chicken Fajitas

This is one of the recipes I got from [Budget
Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/02/oven-fajitas/) that inspired
me to create this blog. It's simple, cheap, and delicious. With recipes
like this, there's no excuse to dine out for every meal.

There are lots of ingredients here, but the spices should be leftovers from
all the other cooking you've been doing, so you should just have to pick up some
chicken, an onion, and some bell peppers. Different colored bell peppers are
differently-priced, who knew?

## Ingredients

### Spices

* 1 Tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 Tbsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 Tbsp corn starch

### Fajitas

* 1 medium red onion
* 3 medium bell peppers (mix up the colors if you want)
* 1 lb. chicken breast or thighs
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp cilantro
* 8 flour tortillas

### Mixins

* Sour cream
* Cheese

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400°. Mix the spices together in a small bowl and set aside. Slice
the onion into medium bits. Quarter the peppers, and cut into 1/4"-wide strips. Finally,
trim any excess fat off the chicken, and cut into strips.

Combine vegetables and chicken into glass baking dish. Sprinkle spice mix over
the top. Add vegetable oil and stir until combined. Bake for 45 minutes,
stirring once halfway through.

When complete, sprinkle cilantro on top. Serve with sour cream and cheese.

![The ingredients](1-ingredients.jpg)

![Measuring the spices](2-spices.jpg)

First, mix all the spices together with the corn starch.

![Mixing the spices](3-spices.jpg)

Set aside for later, we've got lots of cutting to do.

![Prep the chicken](4-chicken.jpg)

I did the chicken first. I recommend doing the vegetables first.

![Dress the chicken](5-dress-chicken.jpg)

Trim the excess fat off the chicken. Breasts may not have that much, but
thighs, like these, probably will.

![Slice the chicken](6-cut-chicken.jpg)

Then slice it into 1/2" thick slices.

![Chicken's done](7-chicken-done.jpg)

Place the chicken in a glass baking dish.

![Don't cross-contaminate](8-contaminated.jpg)

Here's the reason to do the chicken last: These knives must be cleaned well before
they can be used again to avoid cross-contamination. Since I only have one cutting
board, I have to wash that too. (note to self: get a set of 3 cutting boards)

![Cutting peppers](9-peppers.jpg)

We want to end up cutting this pepper into strips along its side.

![Cutting the pepper top off](10-peppers-top.jpg)

To start, cut out the stem from the top. Pull it out, and all the seeds should
come with it.

![Cutting the pepper bottom off](11-peppers-bottom.jpg)

Next cut the bottom off. Those little black specks are mold. Since they aren't big,
we can just throw them away. I lived to write this, so I'm fine (though another
pepper I had was not so appealing when I opened it up...)

![Quarter the pepper](12-peppers-sides.jpg)

Now quarter the pepper down from the top. Finally, slice each quarter into strips
from the side.

![Peppers done](13-peppers-done.jpg)

Add the peppers to the pan.

![Green peppers too!](14-more-peppers.jpg)

And add some more peppers too while we're at it.

![Onion split in half](15-onion-split.jpg)

To cut the onion, first split it completely in half.

![Onion cut up to the root](16-onion-sliced.jpg)

Next, cut it up to, but not through, the root.

![Onion sliced across](17-onion-diced.jpg)

Finally, slice it across to finish it.

![Onion added to pan](18-onion-done.jpg)

Add the onion to the pan.

![Add the spices to the pan](19-spices-added.jpg)

Sprinkle the spices over the top of the chicken and vegetables.

![Add the oil to the pan](20-oil-added.jpg)

Add the oil on top.

![Stir the mix together](21-swish.jpg)

Stir the mix together. I've found it's easiest to do by hand, especially considering
how full the pan is by now.

![Got messy](22-messy.jpg)

I could do without getting messy, but it's delicious enough that I'll get over it.

![Cooked](23-cooked.jpg)

Put the pan in the 400° oven for 45 minutes. After 25 minutes, give it a good stir.
If you want to add rice to make it a burrito, start the rice about 15 minutes before
the timer is done.

![Add cilantro](24-cilantro-es-bueno.jpg)

After it's done, add the cilantro over the top.

![Burrito fixins](25-burrito-fixins.jpg)

Now we can assemble a burrito.

![Rice](26-rice.jpg)

Start with a bed of rice.

![Fajita filling](27-filling.jpg)

Add the fajita filling.

![Sour cream](28-sour-cream.jpg)

Add some sour cream.

![Cheese](29-cheese.jpg)

And cheese. The first time I made these, I didn't add cheese, and they were still
delicious, so if you're on a budget or a diet, you can leave this out.

I would not add any salsa, the spice mix is spicy enough, though other mixins might
do well (pico de gallo or corn perhaps).

![Wrap it up](30-snuggie.jpg)

Wrap it up by folding up the bottom first, folding in the sides, and then
rolling it up.

And there it is!
