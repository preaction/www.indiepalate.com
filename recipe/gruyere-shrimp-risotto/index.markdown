Risotto seems like one of those recipes that can soak up pantry
ingredients. Here's some leftover shrimp and cheese I had laying around,
along with an onion and some garlic. I've been keeping a good stock of
broths on-hand, and the standard grains like rice.

We can start the onion. We want it to sweat so we get the flavor, but we
don't want it to brown, so keep the heat low.

We can add the rice, and mix things up a bit. Keep stirring the rice for
a couple minutes, until it gets a slight golden color.

We can start adding the broth, about 1/2 cup at a time. Keep the heat on
medium here, and keep stirring until the liquid thickens or evaporates.
