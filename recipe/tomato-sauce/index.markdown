# Tomato Sauce

Home-made tomato sauce is wonderful. The rich, bright, fresh flavors
just can't be found in a jar. With this recipe, you can have fresh
tomato sauce in about 45 minutes.

Don't leave out the wine. Tomatoes have alcohol-soluble flavors that
only come out with alcohol. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe (unless
you've got an allergy).

## Equipment

* Large sauce pan
* Immersion (stick) blender

## Ingredients

* 1 small onion, diced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 stalk celery, sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 oz olive oil
* 1 28oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 6 oz can tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp basil
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp capers rinsed and drained
* 1/4 c white wine
* 1/2 c water
* salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and sweat the onion,
carrot, and celery until tender. Add the garlic and cook for a minute or
so, then add the tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, herbs, sugar, capers,
wine, and water (everything but the salt and pepper). Bring to a boil,
reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes.

After the 30 minutes are up, or a bit more, remove from heat and let
cool for a little bit before blending smooth with an immersion blender.
Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

![Ingredients for tomato sauce](01-ingredients.jpg)

Not a lot of esoteric ingredients here, which is good. Only unique thing
are the capers. I've never used them before, and so far have only used
them in tomato sauce.

![Carrot on a cutting board](02-carrot.jpg)

We've got a bit of cutting to do here, but first, we've got to peel it.

![Carrot being peeled in a sink](03-peel-carrot.jpg)

Gently peel the carrot. The skin is thin, and you don't want to remove
too much of the good stuff.

![Peeled carrot on a cutting board](04-carrot-peeled.jpg)

Once it's peeled, we need to dice it.

![Carrot chopped into 2-inch pieces](05-carrot-chop.jpg)

Start by chopping into 2-inch pieces.

![Carrot sliced into batonnet](06-carrot-batonnet.jpg)

Then slice those pieces into 1/2-inch-wide sticks.

![Carrot diced](07-carrot-dice.jpg)

Finally, cut the sticks into 1/2-inch cubes.

![Celery on a cutting board](08-celery.jpg)

Next, the celery gets the same treatment.

![Celery washed and trimmed](09-celery-trimmed.jpg)

First, we need to wash and trim off the top and bottom.

![Celery chopped into 2-inch pieces](10-celery-chop.jpg)

Then, like the carrot, chop into 2-inch pieces...

![Celery sliced into batonnet](11-celery-batonnet.jpg)

... then slice into 1/2-inch-wide sticks...

![Celery diced](12-celery-dice.jpg)

... and finally into 1/2-inch cubes.

![Onion on a cutting board](13-onion.jpg)

The onion gets a similar treatment, but we can do it a bit easier.

![Onion with top removed](14-onion-top-removed.jpg)

First, remove the top so it will sit on the cutting board.

![Onion peeled and halved](15-onion-peeled-and-halved.jpg)

Next, cut down through the root, so that the root holds each half
together. Then, peel off the skin.

![Onion sliced across](16-onion-batonnet.jpg)

Slice down the onion, about 1/2-inch apart, but don't cut through the root.

![Onion diced](17-onion-dice.jpg)

Finally, slice across the onion into 1/2-inch pieces.

![Mirepoix in a bowl](18-mirepoix.jpg)

This combination of equal parts onion, celery, and carrot is called
mirepoix.

If you, like me, bought more than one onion, one carrot, and
one stalk of celery, you can chop up the rest of it and freeze it,
together or separately, for easy sauce-making later.

![Garlic cloves on a cutting board](19-garlic.jpg)

To mince fresh garlic, first we have to peel it. But it's a lot easier
to peel garlic when it's been smashed first.

![Garlic cloves smashed on a cutting board](20-garlic-smash.jpg)

Smash the garlic with the flat of your chef's knife. Place the knife on
the garlic clove and press down until crushed.

![Smashed garlic cloved peeled](21-garlic-peeled.jpg)

The skin should then come off easily.

![Garlic minced](22-garlic-minced.jpg)

Once peeled, mince the garlic by cutting into tiny strips, and then cutting
the tiny strips into cubes, and then rocking your knife back and forth
until minced fine.

![Oil in a sauce pan](23-oil-pot.jpg)

Now we've got all the prep done, we can start making the sauce. Heat
the oil in a saucepan.

![Sweating the mirepoix](24-sweat-mirepoix.jpg)

Then sweat the mirepoix. Sweating is done at lower heat to get the
flavors out.

![Mirepoix done](25-mirepoix-done.jpg)

Once the mirepoix is tender, it's done and we can add the tomatoes.

![Adding the tomatoes and tomato paste](26-add-tomatoes.jpg)

Add the diced tomatoes, with liquid, and the tomato paste. Stir well.

![Adding all the other ingredients](27-add-everything-else.jpg)

Then add everything else. It really is just that simple!

![Mixing it all together](28-mix-together.jpg)

Mix it all together, cover, and bring to a boil.

![Simmering covered](29-simmer.jpg)

Once boiling, simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.

![Stick blender in the pot](30-stick-blender.jpg)

Once the time is done, get your immersion blender and blend until
smooth.

![Tomato sauce blended with stick blender](31-blended.jpg)

The sauce will brighten with the orange from the carrot.

![Tomato sauce done](32-done.jpg)

And you're done! Fresh pasta sauce that beats any can or jar!
