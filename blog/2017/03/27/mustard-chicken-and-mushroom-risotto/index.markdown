title: Mustard Chicken and Mushroom Risotto
---

This is a good show of how much I've learned over the last 2 years:

1. The chicken breasts were seasoned with Lawry's, pan-seared on a hot
   pan with a bit of oil for browning, and then finished in a 400Â° oven
2. While the chicken finished in the oven, I prepared the risotto,
   mostly from [this recipe from
   myrecipes.com](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/mushroom-barley-risotto)
   (though I've learned from Emeril's recipe, and [these risotto
   techniques from The
   Awl](https://theawl.com/how-to-make-perfect-risotto-8a72abcd183a)
3. A cup of milk deglazed the pan, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 2 tbsp of
   dijon mustard, some salt, some pepper, and 1 tbsp of flour created
   a pan sauce

And one thing I haven't learned:

1. Frozen broccoli looks kind of silly next to the rest of this...

Altogether I like the formula: One difficult or involved thing
(risotto), one moderately-complex thing (the pan sauce), and the rest
easy things (chicken and broccoli). I spent about an hour in the
kitchen, and created something wonderful!
