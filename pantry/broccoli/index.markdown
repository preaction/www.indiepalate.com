# Broccoli

Broccoli is an edible flowering from the same species as
[cauliflower](/pantry/cauliflower), cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts.
The edible part of broccoli is called a "stalk", and consists of a bunch
of florets.

Broccoli florets, once removed from the stalk, can be easily prepared by
boiling, steaming, sauteing, roasting, pickling, or eaten raw.

## Purchase

Broccoli florets should be bright green and tightly-closed. Stalks
should be firm but not woody. Avoid broccoli with yellowing florets.

Broccoli freezes well, so if you're pressed for time, or only need
a little bit, it's okay to buy frozen.

## Storage

Store in the coldest part of the fridge, and keep it dry. Use within
7 days.
