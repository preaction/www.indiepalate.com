title: Pistachio Muffins
---

Pistachio is one of my favorite flavors. When I decide to splurge on ice
cream, it's always Ben and Jerry's Pistachio Pistachio (so good). When
I need a cheap fix, it's instant pistachio pudding. But one thing I miss
from the bakery back in Wisconsin is pistachio muffins. So when
I stumbled across [this recipe for Pistachio Muffins from My Momma Told
Me](http://mymommatoldme.com/pistachio-muffins-sugar-crust/), I was
curious. When I found out it used pistachio pudding mix for flavor,
I had to try it.

This recipe was so good, it might break me from my recent scone habit.
It comes together quickly, same as any muffin recipe. There's almost too
much for my muffin pan, but that meant big, mushrooming muffins.

Pistachio pudding mix was 4/$2.00 last week. I think I found what I'll
use the rest for.
