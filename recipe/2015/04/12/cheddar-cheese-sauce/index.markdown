The mac and cheese experiment started with [the classic mac and
cheese](/kitchen/2015/03/15/the-mac-and-cheese-experiment---1---classic-mac). From
there, I went on to [the deluxe
boxes](/kitchen/2015/03/22/the-mac-and-cheese-experiment---2---deluxe-mac).
Finally, I [tried some pre-made sauce, and refamiliarized myself with
Velveeta](/kitchen/2015/04/05/the-mac-and-cheese-experiment---3---pre-made-sauces).

For this final installment, a cheddar cheese sauce, from scratch.

Béchamel is one of the 4 [mother
sauces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mother_sauces) (5 if you add
hollendaise). Once you have a béchamel, you can add all kinds of things to
create other sauces. Different cheeses are common, along with different spices
(I promise I'll make an Alfredo sauce later).

A béchamel is a very simple ratio of 1:1:1:

* 1 tbsp butter (fat)
* 1 tbsp flour (starch)
* 1 cup milk (liquid)

The first two parts, the butter and flour, are combined to form a roux. Roux is
used as a thickening agent for soups and sauces. The roux forms gluten to do
its job. If you're gluten-free, you can use corn starch. You'll need half as
much corn starch as you would flour, but you also won't need butter. The
specifics of that are up to you.

For our purposes, 2 cups of liquid will create the amount of sauce we need
for 16oz of pasta. So, we'll need 2 tbsp of butter, and 2 tbsp of flour.

My cheddar cheese sauce wasn't nearly as smooth as I hoped. I think the liquid
needs to be added in one smooth go. It did reach the right thickness and
consistency though.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 c. whole milk
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese

## Instructions

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, add the flour and
let simmer until it lightens slightly. The roux will smell nutty when ready.

Add the milk and whisk to incorporate. Heat slowly, whisking frequently. Add
salt and pepper to taste. Continue heating until thickened. Do not boil!

Once thickened, add cheese and melt until smooth (switch to a spoon, because whisks
are harder to clean with cheese on them).

It takes a minute or two for the roux to cook. It will get very slightly lighter
before getting darker again. When it lightens is when the liquid should be added.
Darker roux is used for other sauces.

You can test the thickness of the sauce using the back of a spoon. The sauce should
stick a bit.
