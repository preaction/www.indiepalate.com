I've always shied away from puff pastry. On the one side, I've felt that
if I don't make it myself, it's not really cooking. On the other side,
it's always seemed like something difficult to work with, and I've got
so many other things to learn, right? So it's really not worth the
hassle.

But I stumbled across a Tasty gif on Imgur (I know, I feel terrible)
that showed some very simple fruit-and-cheese pastries. Out of courtesy,
I'll link to [their recipe for four ways to use puff
pastry](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alvinzhou/heres-four-ways-to-make-incredibly-beautiful-desserts-with-p?bffbtasty),
but remember that it's Buzzfeed, and I'm sorry.

I could've said I got it from Alton Brown's Good Eats. Why didn't I just
say that? Now y'all know I visited... Buzzfeed...

If you're not brave enough to venture to that dank jungle of memes,
here's my version of the same. Blueberries were on sale, but this would
work with strawberries or other small wild berries, and next time I'd
love to make some apple and cheese pastries.
