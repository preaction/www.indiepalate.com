title: Poached Eggs
---

The last time I tried poaching an egg, it went horribly. They got
poached, technically, but the water was milky white with strands of egg
white, like an egg drop soup. The resulting poached egg was ugly and
disappointing.

This was 4 years ago, so in anticipation of making some Croque Madame
sandwiches tomorrow, I decided to try poaching a couple eggs for
breakfast today. So I looked up some resources (like [this BBC video on
egg
poaching](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/videos/techniques/how-poach-egg)
and [this Kitchn article on egg
poaching](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-poach-an-egg-easily-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-205661))
and decided to give it another go. Here's the result, with some Lawry's
salt and black pepper:

Adding a splash of vinegar to the water really seemed to help. Proper
temperature control seems key: The more violently the water is boiling,
the most wispy and less cohesive the poached egg. Both articles I read
recommended poaching for 4 minutes, which resulted in a yolk that barely
ran. I might go for 15-30 seconds less next time, I like my yolks a bit
more runny. I did not "spin" the water to make a whirlpool: That's what,
I think, caused all my problems last time.

Altogether, I'm glad this worked: I love eggs, and learn yet another way
to cook them is fun!
