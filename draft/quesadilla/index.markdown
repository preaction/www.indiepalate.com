A quesadilla is like a [grilled
cheese](/blog/2016/08/18/grilled-cheese), but with a tortilla instead.
Since tortillas are a bit bigger, and a bit thinner, than standard loaf
bread, this means more cheese!

Like grilled cheese, you can fill a quesadilla with other things, like
[eggs and mushrooms](/blog/2016/07/21/breakfast-quesadilla) or meat.
Then you can serve with refried beans, sour cream, and salsa, using the
quesadilla like a big, cheese-filled tortilla chip.
