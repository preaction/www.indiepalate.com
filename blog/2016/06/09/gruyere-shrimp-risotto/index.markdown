I love risotto. It takes some effort, but that effort is rewarded with
a delicious, creamy, flavorful rice dish. I've been making risottos for
a while. I made a mushroom parmesan barley risotto with [poulet au vin
blanc](/blog/2016/02/24/poulet-au-vin-blanc/), a few months back.

This [gruyere and shrimp risotto](/recipe/gruyere-shrimp-risotto/) was
a departure from the recipe I found, which called for asiago and
a pressure cooker. I made mine in the classic way, on the stove, slowly.
I had some gruyere left over from [the potato dauphinois a few weeks
ago](/blog/2016/05/25/potato-dauphinois/), and some shrimp that were
starting to get a little freezer burn (leftover from [shrimp
etouffee](/blog/2016/05/25/potato-dauphinois/)).

It turned out amazing. The gruyere is sharp but not overpowering. The
shrimp lends a wonderful flavor. And it went great with the poulet,
which I'm always a fan of.
