title: Almond Snowball Cookies
---

Grandma would make these oblong, sugar-coated cookies every Christmas,
and it's taken me years to find the recipe. I finally stumbled across
[this recipe for Snowball Cookies on What's Cooking
America](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Cookie/RussianTeacakes.htm). I'm
glad I did, because I've always loved these cookies above (most) others.

These cookies are simplicity itself: Butter, powdered sugar, vanilla,
flour, and some toasted nuts. I chose almonds, but walnuts or pecans are
good as well.

If you're craving cookies and don't have a lot of ingredients, these are
a good choice!
