title: Tuna Lemon and Herb Pasta
---

I love the versatility of pasta. With just a few pantry ingredients, you
can make a delicious meal. But not always, [like this Tuna Lemon and
Dill recipe from Olive
Magazine](http://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/linguine-with-tuna-lemon-and-dill/3156.html).

I made some modifications due to the nature of US grocery stores and
Imperial units, and my appalling lack of fresh dill, and the result was
interesting, for a little while. I couldn't bring myself to finish it
all, though.

If I had a rating system based on how many days of leftovers I could
tolerate, this recipe would get a 2/5. Other people might find it
appetizing, but this is definitely not my style of food.
