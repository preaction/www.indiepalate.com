title: Bacon Onion Frittata
---

I love frittatas! Single-serving frittata isn't exactly the right way to do it,
but it's easier than an omelette and has golden-brown deliciousness. I follow
[Alton Brown's frittata
recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/frittata-recipe.html)
with only 2 eggs and varying mixins like this bacon onion frittata with
breakfast potatoes (but always keep the parmesan cheese, it really ties the
flavors together).

Other things I've added to frittata include:

* Herbs like basil and thyme
* Various cheeses including pepperjack, colby, and cheddar
* Sausage
* Mushrooms
* Broccoli

I think frittatas are my new favorite egg dish. Omelettes are great, but
a bit challenging to make. Frittatas are all the flavor and none of the
work!
