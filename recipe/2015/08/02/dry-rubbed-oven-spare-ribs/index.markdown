title: Dry Rubbed Oven Spare Ribs
---

Besides the [pot roast a few weeks back](/recipe/2015/06/21/italian-style-pot-roast),
I haven't done very much in the realm of roasing and braising. But, since exploration
is what this blog is about, and they were on sale, I decided to make some ribs.

I wanted to keep it simple, so these ribs were dry-rubbed, wrapped in foil, and
tossed in the oven.

I got this [recipe from the Man Fuel
blog](http://manfuelblog.com/2013/07/18/dry-rubbed-fall-off-the-bone-beef-ribs-in-the-oven/).

I've never done this before, but it was pretty easy. It just takes a really,
really long time: 4-5 hours total. 1-2 hours marinating, and 3-4 hours baking
in the oven.

While you're waiting for the ribs to cool, you can toss together some biscuits
and instant mashed potatos (I'm not normally a fan, they always end up kind of
gummy, but they were here and I needed some veggies).

They were truly fall-off-the-bone tender, though the sugared rub leaked out of
the foil packet and carmelized on the pan. I think next time I need to make the
packet better to keep in all the juices, but they still tasted pretty good
(which I imagine was mostly the BBQ sauce).

It just takes so damn long...

## Ingredients

* 1.5-2 lbs beef ribs
* 2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp oil
* BBQ sauce

## Instructions

Put all the spices in a bowl. Add the oil, and mix well. Spread the rub over
all sides of the ribs. Put the ribs in an airtight container for 1-2 hours, or
overnight if desired.

Preheat oven to 250Â°. Wrap all the ribs in aluminum foil, place on a
baking sheet, and bake for 3-4 hours.

Afterward, open the top of the aluminum foil, set the oven to broil, and broil
for about 5 minutes.

Remove from oven, spread on some BBQ sauce, and serve.

Not a lot of ingredients here, which is good.

![Put the spices in a bowl](02-spices.jpg)

Put the spices in a bowl.

![Add the oil](03-oil.jpg)

Add the oil and mix it all together.

![The finished rub](04-the-rub.jpg)

The rub will look like this when ready.

![Rub the front](05-front-rub.jpg)

Rub all sides of the ribs.

![Rub the back](06-back-rub.jpg)

Then, get out the tin foil.

![Onto foil](07-onto-foil.jpg)

Place the foil onto a baking sheet, and put the ribs on the foil.

![Wrap the ribs](08-wrapped.jpg)

Wrap the ribs, putting the seam on the top. My big mistake was putting
the seams on the bottom, which let the rub leak out of the foil with the
escaping water from the ribs.

![Put in the oven](09-ovened.jpg)

Put them in the oven, and then go watch a movie. I recommend [Kingsman:
The Secret Service](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802144/).

After the movie, you can make whatever other accompaniment you want
(potatoes and biscuits sounded good to me).

![It's done!](10-done.jpg)

Once they're done, remove them from the oven.

![Open the top](11-opened.jpg)

Open the top and look inside. If you'd like, turn on the broiler and
toss them back in the oven for 5 minutes to develop the color.

![Add BBQ sauce](12-sauced.jpg)

Add some BBQ sauce right before serving.
