title: Bean and Rice Burritos
---

Another one from the dawn of my culinary bachelor past. This dish is
easy, cheap, nutritious, and delicious. It's so easy, I've lost the
recipe, I haven't made it in 5 or more years, and still I was able to
figure it back out from scratch.

This is a classic easy weeknight meal. Make some rice (20 minutes),
build the burritos (5 minutes), and bake for 20 minutes, and you're
done. The main ingredients, rice and beans, are pantry staples. The most
expensive ingredient is the cheese, but it's good to keep some cheese
around for cheese emergencies (though, in my opinion, the only emergency
is not having cheese).
