A recent trip to Lyon, France has destroyed any sense of a routine in
which to cook, so I've been playing with sandwiches and eating more
fresh fruit and vegetables. Trouble is these things go bad a bit faster
than I can get through them, so I've been looking at a variety of ways
to use them.

Which brought me to [this Apple Crisp recipe from
SeriousEats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/best-easy-apple-crisp-crumble-recipe.html).
I made some very small adjustments for the ingredients I had on-hand,
and produced [my own Apple Crisp](/recipe/apple-crisp). It takes about
20 minutes of work, and 45 in the oven, and is a great way to use up
a bunch of extra apples.

Next time I'm definitely going to add the lemon zest, and perhaps add
the lemon juice to the apples to prevent that bit of browning they get
(citrus juices prevent oxidation). And I'm going to try adding the
pecans, which are good to have around the pantry anyway, and should give
a good bit of contrasting texture.
