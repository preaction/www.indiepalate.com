title: 'Rice Pilaf, Pork Chops, and Green Beans and Tomatoes'
---

The plan tonight was to make a risotto again. Then I forgot to buy the
mushrooms. Unfortunately, I still had some beef stock to use up. So, as I had
been perusing some coffee table books, I came across a recipe for rice pilaf.

Making pilaf is pretty simple: Melt some butter, sweat some onions, cook the
rice a bit, then add the stock, boil, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed.
For improvisation, it turned out fantastic (and now that I think of it, Spanish
Rice is very similar to Pilaf...)

The same cookbook had a recipe for green beans and tomatoes, which turned out
pretty well, but I forgot the basil, which likely would've made it better.

All this was in accompaniment to some pork chops I picked up and pan-fried with
some Lawry's.

Altogether it turned out terrific, but I need to keep working on my vegetable
sides.
