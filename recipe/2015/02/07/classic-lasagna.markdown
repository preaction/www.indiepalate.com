About a month ago, someone put the idea of a "breakfast lasagna" in my head. It
turned out not to be what I thought, but I tried it anyway. I took scrambled
eggs, onions, green peppers, cheese, and bacon, layered it all with lasagna
noodles, and served it with sour cream. It was not terrible, but I used _way_
too much onion by far, so it was also not very good, and I will have to revisit it...

But, I used only half of the lasagna noodles I bought, so I decided to make a
classic lasagna like Grandma used to make (for Christmas, I swear, we had
Christmas lasagna. I love you, Grandma).

A classic lasagna is only barely more difficult than Spaghetti Bolognese. It
takes all the same ingredients, adds some cheese, and bakes it like a
cassarole.

## Ingredients

* 8 oz (9 pieces) lasagna noodles
* 4 tbsp. olive oil
* 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1/4 tsp. red pepper
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 25 oz. jar tomato sauce
* 15 oz. Ricotta cheese
* 1 egg
* 8 oz. Mozarella cheese
* 1 cup Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Start cooking the noodles according to the package
directions.

While the noodles are cooking, heat a skillet and cook the olive oil and garlic
until fragrent. Add the beef and cook until brown. Drain.

In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese and the egg.

After the noodles are cooked, the meat browned, and the ricotta and egg mixed,
spread some tomato sauce in the bottom of a 13"x9" baking dish. Lay 3 noodles
across the bottom of the pan. Add a layer with half the cheese, then half the
beef, then half the sauce.  Lay another row of noodles, the rest of the cheese,
beef, and sauce. Top the lasagna with one more layer of noodles, and some sauce
to keep the top from getting too crispy in the oven.

Bake the lasagna for 45 minutes, or until the top noodles are just getting
crisp around the edges. Remove from oven and let sit for 20-30 minutes before
serving.

### Cooking the Meat

I made the mistake of not draining the beef fat after cooking, making a greasy
aftertaste. Do not forget to drain the beef!

### Layering the Lasagna

This was terrible sauce. I really need to make a good bolognese recipe.
