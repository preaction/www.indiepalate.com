title: Chicken Lunch Wraps
---

I've been looking for a quick, easy, and healthy lunch. Unfortunately,
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches fill only two of those requirements
(especially when eaten daily). I've also been looking to up my greens
intake.

In the building I used to work in, they had an excellent deli that
served fresh sandwiches and wraps. For the longest time, I ate the club
sandwich. But, one day I decided to try their grilled chicken wrap, and
I was hooked.

So here's [a chicken lunch wrap recipe](/recipe/chicken-lunch-wraps). It
requires a little prep, but the chicken can be made in large batches and
kept for a week. I went with cabbage, which has a different flavor.
I tried two variations: Ranch dressing (unhealthy) with cheddar, and
fat-free Italian dressing (healthy) with pepperjack, both to good
effect.

Here's to a week's worth of healthy lunches!
