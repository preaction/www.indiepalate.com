Tonight, I made Chicken Paprikash, a Hungarian stew featuring Paprika,
from [this recipe by A Dish of Daily
Life](http://www.adishofdailylife.com/2016/04/chicken-paprikash-recipe/).

I only had plain paprika, not the hungarian paprika called for in the
recipe, so I gain no points for authenticity. It didn't matter, because
this still tasted delicious. It takes a bit of time, but it's pretty
easy to make, and absolutely worth it.
