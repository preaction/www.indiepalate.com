# Cauliflower

Cauliflower is an edible flowering from the same species as broccoli,
cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts. The edible unit of cauliflower is
called the "head", and consists of a bunch of florets.

Cauliflower florets, once removed from the stalk, can be easily prepared
by boiling, steaming, sauteing, roasting, pickling, or eaten raw.

Cauliflower comes in multiple colors, like white, green, orange, and
purple, but white is the most commonly found in supermarkets.

## Purchase

When buying white cauliflower, avoid heads with black spots, blemishes,
and bruising. The cauliflower should be a creamy white color, and should
feel heavy for its size.

## Storage

Most often cauliflower will come wrapped tightly in plastic, which traps
moisture and can make it spoil faster. A whole cauliflower head will
keep 4-7 days if wrapped loosely in a plastic bag with some paper towel
to absorb excess moisture.
