title: Spicy Penne and Sausage
---

This is currently one of my favorite recipes. It's got everything I love:
Spicy, pasta, cheese, and mushrooms. It's relatively easy to make, and the
ingredients are not too expensive. It makes a lot of food, especially when you
add extra bell peppers.

Make sure to slice the vegetables before starting anything. It doesn't take
long, and it ensures that you aren't rushed when you're cooking. I didn't, and
if you look carefully in the pictures, you can see how they're out-of-order ;).

## Ingredients

* 16 oz penne pasta
* 1 lb spicy Italian sausage
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 8 oz mushrooms, sliced
* 3 bell peppers (any color), chopped
* salt and pepper
* 2 tsp garlic
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 c half and half
* 1 c parmesan cheese

## Instructions

Prepare pasta according to package directions.

While the water is boiling, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-high
heat until brown. Set aside.

In same skillet, heat oil and garlic over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, bell
pepper, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Salt and pepper to taste. Saute until
mushrooms and peppers are tender (about 5-7 minutes).

Add half and half. Bring to a boil and simmer 1 minute. Add pasta, sausage, and
parmesan cheese. Toss to coat. Sauce will thicken in the starch of the pasta.

### Slicing the Ingredients

The original recipe called only for red bell peppers, but I like adding green
peppers to make it colorful.

The unsliced mushrooms are significantly cheaper, and slicing mushrooms takes
almost no time. It is also a lot easier to clean whole mushrooms. Don't forget
to clean mushrooms!

I used to think fresh garlic was too much work and that garlic powder was
just as good. I was wrong. I admit it. Fresh garlic is a nice, mild flavor that
doesn't overpower, and mincing takes only a few minutes.

The grocery store where I shop rarely has bulk Italian sausage, so I usually
end up cutting about 4-5 sausages into 1/2" thick slices. I like the shape, and
the result, better than crumbled sausage.

The vegetables cook down nicely in the oil, garlic, and spices.

After warming the half-and-half, the sauce comes together with the starch of
the pasta.

There is a lot of food here, and I really need to buy a deeper skillet...
