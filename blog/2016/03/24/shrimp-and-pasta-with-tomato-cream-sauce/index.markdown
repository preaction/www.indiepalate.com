title: Shrimp and Pasta with Tomato Cream Sauce
---

Standing in stark contrast to [the last pasta dish
I made](/blog/2016/03/03/tuna-lemon-and-herb-pasta/), there's this one.
The blog I got this from, [The Pioneer
Woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/), calls it [Penne a la
Betsy](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/penne_a_la_betsy/). In my
mundane way, I'm calling it Shrimp and Pasta with Tomato Cream Sauce.

This wonderful, rich, creamy dish comes together quickly and, except for
the shrimp, I had everything I needed: A small can of tomato sauce [from
the Indian-spiced Stew a few weeks
ago](/blog/2016/02/17/indian-spiced-stew/), some pasta I collected ([bow
ties are cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPGTizdGwSc)), and some
cream.  I've started keeping the ultra-pasteurized cream in my fridge
for emergency scone baking and sauces. It keeps for a month, and it's
extremely useful.

I didn't have any white wine left ([thank the chicken for that
one](/blog/2016/02/24/poulet-au-vin-blanc/)), so I just used a bit of
water. This turned out a bit thin, so I let it simmer to thicken it back
up. A bit of chicken stock would help fill in some flavor gaps,
I suspect, if you don't have wine. Personally, I filled those gaps with
some parmesan and red pepper.

All in all, this one was very good. I gorged myself stupid, have plenty
of leftovers, and now, fat and happy, I'm telling you about it.

PS: The leftovers went well mixing the peas right in there.
