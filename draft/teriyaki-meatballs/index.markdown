title: Teriyaki Meatballs

These were supposed to be pork, but I had beef. The teriyaki is good,
but the meatballs need something... More pepper? Something spicy...

I pan-fried them instead of oven-baking them. Get a good brown going.

Mince the onion really, really finely, or else your meatballs will fall
apart. Only use 1/4 of an onion.

Make sure to stir the sauce quickly while adding the starch slurry, or
else it'll have gummy bits in it.
