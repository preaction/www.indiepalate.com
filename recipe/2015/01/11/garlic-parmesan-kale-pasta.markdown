title: Garlic Parmesan Kale Pasta
---

Before tonight, I had never had kale. Of all the greens I've had (which are
lettuce and spinach and now kale), I think I like kale the most.

Kale is annoying to prep, though. First you have to remove it from the stalk.
Then, for this recipe, you need to cut the larger chunks into strips. For 1 lb.
of kale, this took about 15 minutes. In the future, it might be easier to cut
the strips while the kale is on the stalk.

This is [yet another Budget Bytes
recipe](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/10/garlic-parmesan-kale-pasta/). I
really like these recipes, because they aren't overly complicated, and
especially aren't overly expensive.

In order to make this more of a meal, I added 1 lb. of ground turkey. I'm not
sure it was necessary, as the end result was 4 meal-sized servings. But, some
extra protein never hurt nobody.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. (two large bunches) kale
* 1 lb. angel hair pasta
* 2 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. butter
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
* salt & pepper
* red pepper flakes (optional)

### Extras

* 1 lb. ground turkey -- Brown this before cooking the kale

## Instructions

Rip the kale leaves off the stalk. Rinse well and drain. Cut the kale into thin
strips or small pieces. Mince the garlic.

Start preparing the pasta according to directions.

While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil, butter, and minced garlic to a
large skillet. Cook over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is soft
and fragrant. Add the kale and saute until the kale has wilted and has turned
dark green (about 5-7 minutes).

Toss the pasta and kale together. Allow them to cool so that steam is no longer
rising from the pot. The pasta should be warm, but not hot enough to melt the
cheese.

Season the pasta and kale with salt and freshly cracked pepper to your liking.
Add the grated Parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Add some red pepper if
desired.

Here's how the kale should look when it's done.
