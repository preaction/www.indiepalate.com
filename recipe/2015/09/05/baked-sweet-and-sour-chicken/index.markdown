I found this [Baked Sweet and Sour Chicken recipe on Fabulessly
Frugal](http://fabulesslyfrugal.com/sweet-sour-chicken-recipe/) which
they adapted from [this Sweet and Sour Chicken recipe on Mel's Kitchen
Cafe](http://www.melskitchencafe.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken-updated/).
The version I used doubled the sauce, which meant it ended up a bit
thinner and sweeter than I liked. I'm going to try the original next
time.

# Ingredients

## Chicken

* 2 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* salt and pepper
* 1 c cornstarch
* 3 eggs
* 1/2 c vegetable oil for frying

## Sauce

* 1 1/2 c sugar
* 1/2 c ketchup
* 1 c apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp garlic salt

# Instructions

Preheat oven to 325°.

Cut the chicken into 1-inch chunks. Season with salt and pepper. Pour
about 1/4c oil into fry pan and heat until just smoking.

Coat chicken pieces with cornstarch, dip in egg, and pan fry in batches
until golden, about 30 seconds. When done, transfer to 9x13 baking dish.

Mix sauce ingredients together and poor over chicken. Bake for about 1
hour, stirring every 20 minutes to ensure good coating.

Serve over rice.

Not a lot of fancy ingredients, which makes this recipe a breeze.

![Ingredients](01-ingredients.jpg)

Even boneless, skinless chicken breasts have a bit of white fat on them.
Trim this off.

You should be left with a nice clean piece of chicken, and a bit of
white fat.

Next, cut the chicken into chunks. They should be of similar size, so
they all cook evenly.

Prepare the egg wash. A shallow pie pan works well. Scramble the eggs.

Finally, prepare the pans. Get out a 13x9 glass baking dish, and a fry
pan.

Add some oil to the fry pan and start heating it over medium-high heat.
Wait a few minutes until it's hot. The oil should be rippling, and just
barely smoking.

Use an oil with a high smoke point. We want browning and quickly.

Prepare the corn starch. Having a gallon bag to toss the chicken in is a
very good idea. My way was time-consuming and a bit messier, as you can
see.

Ready the chicken by adding some salt and pepper.

Dredge the chicken in the starch first.

Then dip the chicken in the egg and toss into the pan.

Fry in small batches until golden brown, about 30 seconds.

Then move to the baking dish.

Repeat until all the chicken is fried.

Now we can make the sauce.

![The sauce ingredients and equipment](19-sauce-ingredients.jpg)

Start with the sugar.

![Sugar in a medium bowl](20-sugar.jpg)

Add the ketchup, vinegar, and soy sauce.

The vinegar seems strong at first, and the smell will hit right as it
enters the oven. But in the end, the sauce is sweet and tangy.

Top with a bit of garlic powder.

Whisk the mixture together.

Then pour it over the chicken.

Bake in 325° oven for an hour, stirring every 20 minutes. After the
first stir, it will look like so.

After the second stir, the sauce is darkening as it reduces.

After the second stir, start some rice cooking. You'll need a sauce pan.
This one's a bit small, but it was an experiment, and worked just fine.

![A small covered saucepan for the rice](27-start-rice.jpg)

Boil 2 cups of water for 1 cup of rice.

![Boiling water for the rice](28-boiling-water.jpg)

Once the water boils, add the rice.

Cover and bring back to a boil.

Once boiling, turn heat down to low and simmer until all the liquid is
absorbed, about 15 minutes.

Fluff with a fork and let stand a few minutes.

After an hour, the chicken is done.

Serve the chicken atop the rice and enjoy!
