To go along with [last week's White Bean
Soup](/blog/2016/08/11/white-bean-soup/), I decided to make [some
Grilled Cheese](/recipe/grilled-cheese), the classic soup accompaniment.
Besides some trouble with the butter (I would kill for some way to keep
butter at exactly the right temperature for spreading), they turned out
great.

I had some pepperjack cheese laying around, so I used that instead of
the classic American. I've been trying to keep a variety of cheese
bricks around for emergency cheese cravings, and it paid off today.
