title: Buffalo Chicken Bowls

When I started this blog, my refrigerator was practically empty. Now,
I've got half-used bottles of dozens of condiments, all waiting for
their return to the limelight. [Today's recipe, Buffalo Chicken Bowls
from Pretty
Providence](http://prettyprovidence.com/healthy-buffalo-chicken-bowls/),
brought back the buffalo hot sauce (leftover from an interesting pasta
concoction that didn't see the publish button), and hot sauce's natural
frenemy: Ranch dressing.

This recipe was a piece of cake with a slow cooker. The magic formula
for slow-cooking chicken seems to be:

* 2-3 pounds chicken
* 1-2 cups flavorful liquid
* 2-4 cups vegetables (beans, corn, potatoes, onions, carrots, celery)

(for other instances of this formula, see [Taco Chicken
Bowls](/blog/2015/05/10/taco-chicken-bowls) and [Indian Spiced
Stew](/blog/2016/02/17/indian-spiced-stew))

I left out a few ingredients from the recipe, leaving only:

* Chicken
* Buffalo sauce
* Black beans
* Corn
* Rice
* Ranch dressing

In short, this was [the Taco Chicken Bowls
recipe](/blog/2015/05/10/taco-chicken-bowls) with buffalo sauce instead
of salsa, and no need for the spice blend.

Like the Taco Chicken Bowls, this goes great in a bowl with some rice,
a bit of ranch dressing and cheddar cheese, or wrap the lot in a burrito
skin, which is like a tube-shaped bowl you can eat!
