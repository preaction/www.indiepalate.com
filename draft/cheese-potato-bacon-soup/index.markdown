title: Cheese Potato Bacon Soup
---

I'm especially proud of this one, as it's the first recipe I developed
myself, a long time ago.

The mirepoix is a new addition, and I like it. It works. I'm tempted to
leave out the cheese and see what happens, but it's cheese, so I won't.
I will say that I think it tasted better with cheddar, or maybe I just
didn't use enough parmesan...

It takes about 15-20 minutes for the potatoes to become tender. Watch
out, if you overcook them they'll turn into mash, and this isn't a
mashed potato soup.

I used the rest of the broth I had hiding in the fridge, but a
bouillion-based broth works just fine. Check the saltiness by tasting
the broth at the end. The potatoes will soak up salt, so don't try to
fix the saltiness too early.
