Unlike the [cake brownies](), these are rich and moist. Looking over all the recipes
I've got for brownies:

* Eggs and butter for richness
* Flour for structure
* Sugar and chocolate for flavor
* A bit of baking soda for leavening

25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean (but moist).

This was the first time I used unsalted butter in baking. Everything I've read
says you should use unsalted butter in all your baking, but I never cared or
wondered about the difference. Turns out, the different is extremely noticable.
I made one batch with salted, one unsalted, and the unsalted ones turned out a lot
better. The salted butter adds around 1 1/2 tsp of salt, far more than the 1/4 tsp
the recipe calls for.
