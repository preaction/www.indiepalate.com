title: Cinnamon Sugar Almonds
---

This is my favorite part of the [Bristol Renaissance
Faire](http://www.renfair.com/bristol/), even including the mushrooms. It's a
wonderful tasty and filling snack, and easy to boot. If only almonds weren't so
expensive, I'd have these all the time.

The most important thing for this recipe is to keep stirring. Your arm might
get sore, do not stop stirring until the coating is complete and you're
spreading the almonds on a cookie sheet.

## Ingredients

* 3 c. whole almonds, raw
* 1 c. sugar
* 1/2 tbsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 c water

## Instructions

In a large saucepan, combine sugar, cinnamon, and water. Heat over medium heat until
the sugar has dissolved into a syrup.

Add the almonds and stir constantly until the sugar crystallizes, about 8-10
minutes. The mixture will feel sandy.

Spread the almonds in a single layer on a cookie sheet to cool.

Once it looks sandy, dump it all out on a cookie sheet to cool.

Do not stop stirring, or else this will happen, and cleaning up will involve a chisel.
