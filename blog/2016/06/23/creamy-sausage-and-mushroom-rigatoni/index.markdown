Is it still considered Hamburger Helper if it's made with Italian
sausage? If it's not made with powders from bags that come in a box?
I'm not sure if the difference is that distinct...

[This recipe for Creamy Sausage and Mushroom Rigatoni from The Girl Who
Ate
Everything](http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2015/07/creamy-sausage-and-mushroom-rigatoni.html)
is uncannily similar to the [Spicy Penne and
Sausage](/blog/2015/03/01/spicy-penne-and-sausage/)
I've made once in a while.  They could be twins. Feel free to add
parmesan to this, or basil to that. Peas could go well with this, or
maybe some bacon.

In the end, it was easy, inexpensive, and good, which is exactly what
a busy weeknight needs. It's adaptable to what's in the kitchen,
provided you've got some cream or half-and-half on-hand (have
I convinced you yet of their overwhelming utility?).
