# Yogurt

Yogurt is milk cultured with bacteria. The bacteria ferment the milk,
giving it a sour tang.

Greek yogurt (strained yogurt) is strained through a filter to remove
more of the whey, making a thicker yogurt with more protein.

Yogurt is versatile enough that I keep a container in my fridge at all
times.

## Purchase

Look for yogurt in a resealable container (unless it's single-serving).
Check the ingredient list and avoid yogurt with added sugar.

## Storage

Store yogurt in the refrigerator in an airtight container (hopefully the
container it came in). Store it in a cold part of the fridge, low and
away from the door.

Yogurt can last a week or two past its expiration date, but throw it
away immediately if:

* Mold forms. Any mold at all in the container means throw it all away.
* Curds form on the bottom.

During storage, some liquid whey will float to the top. This is normal.
You can ignore it, or you can stir it back in to the rest of the yogurt.

## Uses

* Yogurt is a common ingredient in Middle Eastern and Indian cooking
* Add to oatmeal for a tangy burst of flavor and protein
* Yogurt's acidity works well in marinades

## Substitutions

* Yogurt and sour cream can often be substituted for each other.
  Yogurt's sourness is stronger than sour cream, so make sure to taste
  as you add it.
    * This make yogurt good to use in soups and stews
* Yogurt can also be used in place of mayonnaise
