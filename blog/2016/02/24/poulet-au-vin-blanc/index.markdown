Fancy-speak for "chicken with white wine", [this
recipe](http://vikalinka.com/2014/12/28/coq-au-chardonnay/) is amazing,
easy, and delicious. If you've got chicken, white wine, an onion, some
garlic, and some mushrooms, you can toss this together in a little more
than an hour.

The [site I got this from calls it Coq au
Chardonnay](http://vikalinka.com/2014/12/28/coq-au-chardonnay/), but
since it's not coq but hen (rooster isn't widely-available in
supermarkets), and it wasn't Chardonnay but cheap white wine, I can't
very well keep calling it that.

Since the chicken takes 40 minutes to cook, I had time to make
a mushroom barley risotto. I had some dried porcini mushrooms laying
around, so I rehydrated those and saved the flavorful liquid that
resulted. I combined the mushroom liquid with some beef stock and some
thyme, made a risotto, and then added some good parmesan cheese I had
laying around. The result was better than I had expected.

As with so many good recipes, the biggest problem is that it's gone too
soon...
