title: Dry Rubbed Oven Spare Ribs
---

Besides the [pot roast a few weeks back](/recipe/2015/06/21/italian-style-pot-roast),
I haven't done very much in the realm of roasing and braising. But, since exploration
is what this blog is about, and they were on sale, I decided to make some ribs.

I wanted to keep it simple, so these ribs were dry-rubbed, wrapped in foil, and
tossed in the oven.

I got this [recipe from the Man Fuel blog](http://manfuelblog.com/2013/07/18/dry-rubbed-fall-off-the-bone-beef-ribs-in-the-oven/).

I've never done this before, but it was pretty easy. It just takes a really,
really long time: 4-5 hours total. 1-2 hours marinating, and 3-4 hours baking
in the oven.

While you're waiting for the ribs to cool, you can toss together some biscuits
and instant mashed potatos (I'm not normally a fan, they always end up kind of
gummy, but they were here and I needed some veggies).

They were truly fall-off-the-bone tender, though the sugared rub leaked out of
the foil packet and carmelized on the pan. I think next time I need to make the
packet better to keep in all the juices, but they still tasted pretty good
(which I imagine was mostly the BBQ sauce).

It just takes so damn long...

## Ingredients

* 1.5-2 lbs beef ribs
* 2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp oil
* BBQ sauce

## Instructions

Put all the spices in a bowl. Add the oil, and mix well. Spread the rub over
all sides of the ribs. Put the ribs in an airtight container for 1-2 hours, or
overnight if desired.

Preheat oven to 250Â°. Wrap all the ribs in aluminum foil, place on a
baking sheet, and bake for 3-4 hours.

Afterward, open the top of the aluminum foil, set the oven to broil, and broil
for about 5 minutes.

Remove from oven, spread on some BBQ sauce, and serve.
