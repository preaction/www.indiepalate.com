title: Lemon Cream Cheese Crumb Cake
---

I love lemon. Love it. When I saw this, lemon and cream cheese, I had to
try it, no matter how complicated it looked. It turns out, it's a lot
simpler than it looks!

I found this recipe on [Crunchy Creamy
Sweet](http://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/2015/04/06/lemon-cream-cheese-crumb-cake/)

This is very much a coffee cake. The streusel crumbs, the moist cake,
the cream cheese middle. It's not overly sweet, so it's a nice morning
treat.

This has a bunch of steps, and requires a bunch of bowls (reuse seems to be
fine), but it comes together pretty easily. The middle layer is a bit delicate,
but don't worry too much about it.

It can be hard to see "golden" crumb when it's inside the oven. Take care the
cream cheese filling doesn't get too dark.

## Ingredients

### Cake (Bottom layer)

* 1 1/2 c flour
* 1/2 c sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3/4 c buttermilk or sour milk
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/3 c vegetable oil
* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp fresh lemon zest (altogether you'll need about 1 lemon)
* 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice

### Cream Cheese (middle layer)

* 8 oz. cream cheese
* 1/3 c sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 1 tbsp lemon zest
* 1 egg

### Streusel Topping (top layer)

* 1/4 c unsalted butter, melted
* 1/3 c sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2/3 c flour

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 13x9 baking pan and set aside. Melt the
butter for the streusel, and zest and juice the lemon.

First the cake batter: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour,
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt (all the dry ingredients).
In another bowl, mix together the buttermilk, vanilla, oil, eggs, zest,
and juice (all the web ingredients). Add the wet ingredients to the dry
ingredients, and combine. Spread in bottom of baking pan.

Next, the cream cheese: In a mixer, whip the cream cheese until creamy.
Add the sugar, vanilla, and zest, and mix until combined. Add the egg
and mix well, then spread gently over the top of the cake batter.

Finally, the streusel topping: In a bowl, combine sugar, salt, and
flour. Add melted butter, and mix together with a fork until crumbly.
Spread crumbs all over the top of the cream cheese.

Bake at 350° for about 35 minutes, or until the edges are browned. Let
cool completely in the pan before serving.

The beauty of this is it's mostly baking staples. If you don't have
buttermilk on-hand, regular milk and lemon juice or vinegar can be used
to substitute.

![Melt the butter](02-melted-butter.jpg)

Melt the butter and set it aside to cool.

![Prep the lemon](03-prep-lemon.jpg)

To prep a lemon, we need to get the juice from the inside and the zest
from the outside. The zest has the oil that has the real lemon flavor.

![Break it down](04-bruise-lemon.jpg)

To make the lemon easier to juice, first roll it around to crush all the
inner bits.

![Zest it off](05-zest-lemon.jpg)

To zest a lemon, run a microplane over it until the yellow parts are
gone, and only white bits (the pith) remains. The white bits are bitter,
so don't get them in your zest.

![The white and the yellow](06-the-white-and-the-yellow.jpg)

The white bits on the bottom are done, and the yellow bits on the top
still need some zesting.

![Zestfully clean](07-zestfully-clean.jpg)

Here's the lemon, fully zested.

![And then juice](08-and-then-juice.jpg)

And now we can juice it.

![Slice in half](09-slice-in-half.jpg)

Slice the lemon in half

![Squeeze the lemon](10-squeeze.jpg)

Squeeze out the juice into a container. If you're smart, put a strainer
on top of the container to catch the seeds.

![Remove the seeds](11-remove-seeds.jpg)

Or just pick out the seeds later.

![The setup](12-the-setup.jpg)

Now that we're prepped, we can start mixing.

![Cake dry ingredients](13-dry-ingredients.jpg)

![Add the butter](29-butter.jpg)

Add the melted butter, and mix it together with a fork.

![Streusel done](30-streusel-done.jpg)

When it's done, it'll look crumbly, like this.

![Spread streusel on top](31-streusel-on-top.jpg)

Spread the streusel on top of everything, and then bake for 35 minutes.

![It's done!](32-baked.jpg)

It's done when the edges are golden brown, and the streusel is slightly
golden. Let cool completely, and enjoy!
