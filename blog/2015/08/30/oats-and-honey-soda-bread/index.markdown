title: Oats and Honey Soda Bread with Raisins
---

There's something wonderful about bread. The process is relaxing. The
smell is soothing. The result is delicious.

I've been wanting to make some bread for quite a while. Since I had some
buttermilk from the [Lemon Buttermilk Sheet
Cake](/blog/2015/08/09/lemon-cream-cheese-crumb-cake), I decided to
make [this oat and honey soda bread](#section-2) with a [recipe from
bakingbites.com](http://bakingbites.com/2010/03/oats-and-honey-irish-soda-bread-with-raisins/).

Making bread is easy. No fancy machines needed here. Making a soda bread
is even easier: No yeast activation, and no waiting for dough to rise.
Just a little mixing and a little kneading.

Soda breads are called that because they use baking soda for leavening.
Leavening creates the bubbles and pockets that makes the bread rise.
For the chemists in the room: Baking soda is a base. When it reacts with
an acid, carbon-dioxide is released, forming bubbles.

So, for a soda bread to rise, we need an acid like the acid found in
buttermilk. If you don't have buttermilk, you can substitute whole milk
and some vinegar or lemon juice.

Part of what makes bread so wonderful is how versatile it is. Sweet
breads, savory breads, beer bread, onion bread, breads with different
cereals, cheese bread, nut breads, veggie breads, fruit breads, and
more!

## Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup quick oats
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 tbsp honey
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1/2 cup raisins

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, stir together the dry ingredients: Flour, oats, baking
soda, and salt. Next, add the honey and buttermilk, and stir until dough
forms a ball. Dough should be only slightly sticky, so add more flour if
it's too sticky, or more buttermilk if it's too dry.

Add the raisins and knead the dough for a couple minutes. Place on
baking sheet, and flatten a little so it's 1" to 1-1/2" thick.

Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden. Cool completely on a wire rack.

Not a lot of ingredients here, which is good. Preheat the oven to 400°.

Prepare a baking sheet with a bit of parchment paper. Parchment paper
will help the bread to not stick. Lay it so the curl is facing down, so
it doesn't curl up on you.

Start by adding the flour to a large bowl.

Next the oats.

And then the baking soda and salt.

Make sure to mix the dry ingredients well before adding the wet ingredients,
starting with the honey.

I also added 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, but it wasn't very noticable. Subtle. I
might add a bit more next time, or something more aromatic like nutmeg
or cloves.

Finally, add the milk.

Then stir to combine into a ball.

In this stage, you can adjust the dough. It should be only slightly
sticky, but not dry. I had to add some flour to mine, and I ended up
using closer to 2 c flour.

Once the dough is how you want, add the raisins.

The raisins will get combined as you knead.

Knead the dough in the bowl for a couple minutes to start the glutens
forming.

Then, dump the dough on to the pan.

To bake evenly, you want to spread the dough out a bit, so that it's
only about 1" to 1-1/2" thick.

Then, pop it in the oven for 30-35 minutes.

After 30 minutes, it was a little darker than I wanted. You might want to start
checking it at 25 minutes.

Cool it on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

I could definitely taste the honey flavor. It goes well with butter, and
it's not too sweet, which I like.

For my first time, this turned out really well. I'm looking forward to
trying a lot more breads in the future!
