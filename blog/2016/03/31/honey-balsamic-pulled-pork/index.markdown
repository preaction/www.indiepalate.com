title: Honey Balsamic Pulled Pork
---

I've [been eating](/blog/2016/01/12/honey-sriracha-chicken-drumsticks/)
[way too much](/blog/2016/02/03/jamaican-jerk-chicken/) [chicken
lately](/blog/2016/02/24/poulet-au-vin-blanc/). It's what I know, and
it's not scary. But, experimenting is the entire point of this blog!
So, as an experiment, I bought a 10 lb. pork shoulder! Because the
shoulder does a lot of work, it's good to cook it long and slow to
tenderize it. Enter [this recipe for Honey Balsamic Pulled Pork by
Cooking
Classy](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2014/10/slow-cooker-balsamic-honey-pulled-pork-sandwiches-giveaway/).

I cut my roast in half and tossed it in the slow cooker. Since I had
more roast than the recipe called for, I had to increase the chicken
broth and spices for the braise. During my [last experiment with
balsamic vinegar](/blog/2016/01/12/honey-sriracha-chicken-drumsticks/),
I realized balsamic vinegar is quite powerful, so I only used half of
what the sauce called for. That was absolutely the right decision: The
sauce turned out fruity and sweet, but not overbearing.

This recipe was great for a lazy Sunday: I started the pork, got
groceries, went shopping, relaxed a bit, then had enough time to make
the sauce and some mashed potatoes for a nice dinner. And, I still have
half a pork roast to consider... Maybe some tacos carnitas?
