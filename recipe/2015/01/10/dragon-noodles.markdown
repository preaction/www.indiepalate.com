These spicy noodles are so quick and easy to just toss together. I always have
eggs and butter on-hand, so the only thing I need to grab are green onions (and
those are completely optional).

Another [recipe from Budget
Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/08/spicy-noodles/), I (again) doubled it
to make enough for a meal. Though I'm thinking that some broccoli might make a
good side.

## Ingredients

* 16 oz. spaghetti noodles
* 4 tbsp brown sugar
* 4 tbsp sriracha (rooster sauce)
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1/4 c. butter
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 4 large egg
* 4 sliced green onion
* 1 tbsp cilantro

## Instructions

Start cooking the noodles according to the package directions.

While cooking the noodles, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl stir together the
brown sugar, sriracha, and soy sauce. Set aside.

In a large skillet melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl and
then add to the melted butter. Sprinkle red pepper over eggs.  Stir gently and
cook through. Once the egg is done cooking, turn off the heat to avoid
over-cooking.

When the noodles are tender, drain the water and then add noodles and sauce to
the skillet with the cooked eggs. Turn the heat on to low to evaporate excess
moisture, and stir until everything is coated well with the sauce. Sprinkle the
sliced green onions and cilantro on top.
