As I mentioned with [last week's omelette and hash
browns](/blog/2016/07/14/omelette-and-hash-browns), breakfast is my
favorite meal. Today, to use up the last couple tortillas from [bean and
rice burritos](/blog/2016/07/07/bean-and-rice-burritos), and some of the
omelette additions, I decided to make breakfast quesadillas!

Quesadillas are like grilled cheese sandwiches, but with tortillas. Like
all other grilled cheeses, one can be a purist, or one can add
a multitude of ingredients. I decided to add eggs, cheese, mushrooms,
and onions, my favorite breakfast ingredients.
