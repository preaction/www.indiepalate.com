<em>Sugo alla puttanesca</em> is a simple sauce made of tomatoes, black
olives, capers, and anchovies. Served with spaghetti makes <em>Spaghetti
alla puttanesca</em>.

This comes together quickly, so prep everything before starting the
water for pasta. Start the water, and then immediately start the sauce.
By the time the water boils, you'll be done with the work in the sauce
and just letting it simmer. Then while it simmers, the pasta cooks. Cook
the pasta a little below al dente, then drain and add it to the sauce.
Toss to coat, and let sit for a bit more for the pasta to finish cooking
and soak up some of the sauce.

I combined two recipes I found to make this ([this recipe from
Vikalinka](http://vikalinka.com/2015/03/08/spaghetti-puttanesca/) and
[this recipe from
MyRecipes](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pasta-puttanesca)), so
I wasn't quite sure how it'd turn out. Next time I'm going to chop up
the capers to spread them out a bit. I'm also going to try parsley
instead of basil, as is more traditional, and [the Wikibooks
recipe](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Spaghetti_alla_Puttanesca)
recommended adding some shrimp for protein...
