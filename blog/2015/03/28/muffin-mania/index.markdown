title: Muffin Mania

It started with banana bread. I have been craving banana bread all week. I
would have to buy too many bananas for only one bread, so I thought, I might as
well make two and take some in to work. After checking my recipe, I decided
against it: A single banana bread takes 60 minutes to bake. Since I only have
(currently) one loaf pan, two loaves of banana breads would be two hours. Three
loaves, the bare minimum needed to serve the 36 people in my section of the
building, would be three hours.

But, any quick bread (non-yeast bread) can be made into muffins. So, after
checking a few recipes, I had a plan to make enough muffins for everybody. I
had never made lemon poppy seed muffins before, so that was going to be one
batch. Of course, I would make some banana muffins, and finally, I remembered
some berries were on sale at the grocery store, so I would also make some berry
muffins (it ended up being strawberries).

Baking is pretty easy if you follow the instructions closely. Combine the dry
ingredients together, combine the wet ingredients together, combine the dry
and wet ingredients, add to pan, bake. That wasn't the problem.

The first batch of lemon poppy seed muffins I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice, which
was not nearly enough. So, I have 12 poppy seed muffins with no lemon flavor at
all.

The second batch of lemon poppy seed muffins I used 2 tbsp of lemon juice,
which gives them some lemony flavor, but still not enough. It turns out, you
get a lot more lemon flavor from lemon zest than you do from lemon juice. The
oils in the zest make the flavor. So, I have 12 lemon poppy seed muffins with
a bare hint of lemon flavor.

The next batch of muffins were banana muffins. Mashed bananas are very
difficult to measure, and I didn't add enough. So, I have 12 banana muffins
with very little banana flavor.

The second batch of banana muffins I added 3 bananas instead of two. These
muffins baked up nicely, and have a good flavor. So, out of 48 muffins, I
made 12 good ones.

But even those banana muffins are missing... something... Perhaps I'll try
some streusel topping next time. Or maybe I'll do something extremely rare
for me and add the nuts that most of the recipes call for.

Altogether a disappointing day in the kitchen. Though, last night's [spicy
tomato and shrimp pasta](/blog/2015/01/08/spicy-tomato-and-shrimp-pasta)
was again a success. I think, for cost purposes, I'm going to try substituting
some chicken instead.
