title: Honey Sriracha Chicken Drumsticks
---

The main reason for the new blog format is so that I can write posts
after I cook, while it's all still fresh in my head (and my stomach).

I tried [this recipe for Sticky Honey Sriracha Chicken Drumsticks from
Homemade
Hooplah](http://homemadehooplah.com/recipes/sticky-honey-sriracha-drumsticks/).
Click through for the recipe, and sorry about the invasive ads on that
site. I strongly suggest an ad-blocker. Ad-blockers won't protect
against the 2 pages of introductory narrative though...

Editing and narrative comments aside, these turned out well. The glaze
was tasty, tangy, and sticky, and reduced quickly on the stove (unlike
my attempt at Chicken Adobo last week, but that's another post). Do keep
an eye on the glaze though. I turned my back to cube some potatoes and
it immediately boiled over!

Also be sure to start checking the chicken at about 20 minutes. Or even
reduce the heat after 20 minutes to keep the skin golden and crisp, not
blackened and burnt.

Time permitting, I'll revisit this recipe, and do a full writeup. For
now, these photos will have to do.
