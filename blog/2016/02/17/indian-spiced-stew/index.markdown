I keep promising co-workers that I'll try more Indian food. I enjoy it
immensely every time I have it. And yet, it's a rare night that I will
actually make something Indian, though I have started keeping my pantry
stocked with the right ingredients.

This [Indian Spiced Stew with Chicken and
Potatoes](http://www.seasonsandsuppers.ca/indian-spiced-chicken-stew/)
is easy to make. It only needs a quick sear on the chicken and then
4 hours in the slow cooker. It can be served as-is, or over rice. Do not
forget to add the [yogurt](/pantry/yogurt)! It's mildly spicy and fragrant, and I will
enjoy trying this again.
