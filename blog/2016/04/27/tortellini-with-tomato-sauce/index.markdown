title: Tortellini with Tomato Sauce
---

For some reason, I prefer tortellini to ravioli. Maybe it's the shape,
how it holds onto the sauce, or the ratio of pasta to filling. Whatever
it is, I'm always up for tortellini.

Unfortunately, it's a lot of work to make. This endeavour is best done
with friends in large batches, frozen until ready to eat. The
alternative, ready-made fresh tortellini, is usually outside my budget.
So, when there was a sale, I had to jump on it.

So I bought some chicken and mozarella tortellini. Combined with [my
recipe for tomato sauce](/recipe/tomato-sauce), and some [roasted
cauliflower](/howto/cauliflower/roasted), I had an excellent dinner!

I've been making [this tomato sauce recipe](/recipe/tomato-sauce) for
a few months now, and I have to say I'm not going back to cans or jars.
Tomato sauce is easy (though it does take 30 minutes) and delicious,
with bright flavors that don't seem to survive the canning process.

And, since my oven was empty while making the pasta and sauce,
I [roasted some cauliflower](/howto/cauliflower/roasted) with pepper and
thyme. The result was perfectly browned and tasty.
