title: Shrimp is Better Than Chicken
---

This weekend I decided to revisit [Spicy Tomato and Shrimp
Pasta](/blog/2015/01/08/spicy-tomato-and-shrimp-pasta). I wanted to try
substituting chicken for the shrimp, to try to bring the cost down a bit.

Unfortunately, my brain was switched off, and I kept the butter and oil the
same. The chicken cooked, but it didn't get hot enough to get the browning I
wanted. I've been reading [America's Test Kitchen Complete Cooking for
Two](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Cooking-For-Cookbook/dp/1936493837),
which, in between some good recipes, has some good tips that I wanted to try.

In the end, the substituted chicken was a bit tasteless. I need to add some herbs
and/or spices, remove the butter, reduce the oil, and increase the heat to get some
flavor in it.

But, as always, a bit of parmesan makes it palatable.

To make myself feel better, I decided to make [Chocolate-Chip
Cookies](/blog/2015/04/19/chocolate-chip-cookies), which satisfies me for a
week of snacking.
