# Privacy Policy

I use third-party metrics gathering (Google Analytics), so they're
tracking you. I also use a Pinterest plugin, so they're likely tracking
you too.

I recommend the Ghostery browser add-in if you don't like
this. I generally don't, but I also like watching the visitor count go
up.

# Ad Policy

## No invasive ads

This likely means no ad networks, since they have proven to be
completely incompetent at keeping the invasive ads out.

## No native advertising

If I am being compensated for a blog post, it will be clearly
explained. This includes:

* Paid posts / sponsored content: If someone can convince me the topic
  is worth being paid to write about, I'll say I'm being paid for it.

* Product reviews: If someone bought us something, I'll try it. If I
  don't like it, you might not hear about it. If I like it, you might
  hear about it, but you'll know they bought it for me, and if they paid
  me more for the content.
