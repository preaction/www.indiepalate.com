# Bean and Rice Burritos

These burritos are cheap and easy enough for a rushed weeknight. Cooking
these is mostly waiting: Waiting for the rice to cook, waiting for the
burritos to bake, and waiting for them to cool down enough to eat.

Here's the ingredients. Not much here, and it comes together simply.

First, we cook the rice. Go [check out how to boil rice on a stove
top](/pantry/rice/boil) if you need to. Once the rice is cooked, we
add all the other ingredients to it.

Beans are canned in water, so we'll need to rinse them before we can add
them to the rice.

Dump the beans into a strainer and run water over the beans until the
water runs clear.

Once the black beans have been rinsed, we can add them to the pot.

Next, the salsa. Add a little bit of salsa to the bottom of the baking
dish (about 1/2 cup).

Then pour the rest of the salsa (saving a little to put on top) in with
the rice and beans.

Stir well.

Now we can add the sour cream.

And then the cheese (but remember to save some to put on top).

And mix to combine. Our filling is done and we can start rolling
burritos!

Place about 3/4 cup of filling in the middle of the tortilla.

Then roll it up.

And place it in the baking dish, with the seam side down.

Do this for the rest of the burrito wraps.

Once they're all squeezed into the baking dish

You can top with some cheese, and some of the reserved salsa (which
I forgot here).

Then pop it in the oven.

About 20 minutes later, the edges of the tortillas will just be starting
to turn golden.
