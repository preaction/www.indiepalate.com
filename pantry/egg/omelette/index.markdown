# Omelette

Omelettes are my favorite breakfast food. Scrambled eggs get cooked into
a flat, crepe-like wrapper around some filling like meat, cheese, or
veggies.

For the longest time, I didn't even try to make an omelette. "Omelettes
are hard", I always hear. But after a few failures that ended up as
scrambled eggs, I think I figured out the technique.

## Equipment

* Medium fry pan

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 1 tbsp butter
* Salt
* Pepper

### Additions

* Mushrooms
* Onions
* Shredded cheese
* Ham
* Bacon
* Sausage
* Tomatoes (diced)
* Green Peppers (diced)
* Spinach

## Instructions

Prepare any additions first: Shred cheese, dice and/or saute veggies,
cook meats. Scramble the eggs. In a medium fry pan over medium heat,
melt the butter. Add the eggs and cook slowly. When the top of the eggs
starts to firm up, add the additions in a row in the middle. Flip the
two sides over the middle and serve.

Like so many good meals, it's not about the ingredients, it's about the
preparation. The egg part happens pretty quickly, so make sure you've
got everything ready for that.

![Sliced mushrooms and diced onions on a cutting board](02-veggies-cut.jpg)

For this omelette, I bought some mushrooms and onions. So I diced the
onions and sliced the mushrooms thin so they'd cook faster.

Then I prepped the eggs. I only used 2 eggs, but you can use more. No
milk or cream though.

Scramble them well with a fork in a circular, folding motion.

Finally, I shredded some cheese. Everything goes better with cheese.
A nice melty cheese like cheddar.

![Fry pan with oil on a stove](06-pan-with-oil.jpg)

For sauteeing the veggies, we need a pan with a bit of oil, nice and
hot.

![Mushrooms and onions in a fry pan](07-veggie-saute.jpg)

Saute is high heat and constantly moving, so keep the heat medium-high
and keep moving things around. As long as everything's squeaking and
steaming, it won't burn.

After a few minutes, they'll start looking like this. Keep turning the
mushrooms so they brown evenly on both sides.

When they look like this, they're done. Remove them from the pan to
a plate, as we need the pan for the eggs.

![Butter melting in a medium fry pan](10-buttered-pan.jpg)

Melt the butter in the pan. After the high heat of the saute, we need
our pan to cool down a bit, so melt the butter with the heat off.

Turn the heat on to medium, then pour in the egg. Spread the egg around
to the sides of the pan.

Cook slowly. Because we've only got two eggs, it's thin enough we just
need to wait. If we had more eggs, we'd need to peel back one side of
the omelette to let the uncooked egg on the top make it to the bottom.

![Cheese added in a line in middle of cooked egg](13-egg-cheese.jpg)

Once the egg is cooked through, we can turn off the heat and add the
filling. I added the cheese first, to give it time to melt.

Then the veggies make their encore appearance.

Finally, wrap the sides around the filling, and serve seam-side down.
