It's been a while since I last made something from [Budget
Bytes](http://budgetbytes.com), but [this white bean
soup](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/09/slow-cooker-white-bean-soup/)
is pretty awesome. It's easy, cheap, delicious, and filling. Since
I keep frozen mirepoix around for [tomato sauce](/recipe/tomato-sauce),
this soup just requires dumping the ingredients in the slow cooker and
waiting for a few hours.

If you want a nice, easy, vegan soup, this is it. If you're not vegan,
add some parmesan cheese when serving.
