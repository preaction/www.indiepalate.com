title: Potato Dauphinois
---

I had a bad day, so I decided to splurge on something special: A nice,
expensive wedge of cheese. Gruyere, in fact, a cheese I've never tried
before. I needed it for [this recipe for Potato
Dauphinois](http://www.recipetineats.com/julia-childs-potato-dauphinois-gratin-potato-bake/),
a classic from Julia Child.

I've made a couple potato gratins previously, but this was by far the
best. The gruyere was the perfect choice, though cheddar could do in
a pinch. This time I used heavy cream instead of half-and-half from
other recipes, which I think was the biggest improvement.  I added some
onions to the recipe, because why not? Potatoes always go great with
a little bit of onion.

I served this alongside some basic roasted chicken. Nothing fancy there,
just salt and pepper, and the resulting meal was excellent. I had to
stop myself from gorging myself to save room for the pistachio gelato
I bought for dessert (bad day, remember).
