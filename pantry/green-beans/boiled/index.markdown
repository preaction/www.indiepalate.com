# Boiled Fresh Green Beans

I've had an ongoing indifference towards green beans since I moved out.
Canned beans were a standard staple growing up, and the mushy texture
was not my favorite, despite the amount of butter we used to add some
flavor. Frozen green beans weren't much better: On the rare occasions we
had them, they were kind of bitter with an even stranger texture.

Now that I've tried fresh green beans, I think I'm ready to add them
back to my table. Though washing and cutting the beans takes a bit of
work, the end result is worth it.

## You Will Need

* 1-2 lbs fresh green beans
* Large pot with lid
* Colander
* Salt

### Optional Additions

* Butter
* Black Pepper
* Garlic

## Instructions

Prepare the beans by washing and cutting off stems and tips. Chop into
1-inch long sections.

Bring a small amount of water to a boil. Add salt, then add green beans.
Return to boil, and cook, covered, for 10-15 minutes or until tender.

Add butter, salt, pepper, garlic, or otherwise, and serve.

Like most fresh vegetables, we begin with a wash.

Make sure to get all the garden gunk out of your beans, including any
twigs or other inedibles.

Once we've given our beans a bath, we can trim the stem and tails, if
any. These parts are not appetizing.

Now trimmed, we can cut into chewable sections. Try to keep your chunks
evenly-sized to ensure even cooking.

Here's our 2 pounds of beans ready to go.

Prepare a pot with some water, enough to cover the beans, and set it to
boiling. Remember to cover the pot to make it boil faster.

Add the beans, cover, return to boil, and let cook for 10-15 minutes.

The beans are done when they are tender. You can test their tenderness
with a fork.

Notice that the cooked beans have darkened slightly.

Drain the beans, and then return them to the pot.

Finally, we can season with salt, butter, pepper, garlic, or other
things we might like. I've seen people recommending ginger, and I've got
to try it.

Green beans serve well as a side dish to a main course of
[chicken](/blog/tag/chicken) or [beef](/blog/tag/beef). I decided
I liked the splash of color it brought to [my chicken
parmesan](/recipe/chicken-parmesan).
