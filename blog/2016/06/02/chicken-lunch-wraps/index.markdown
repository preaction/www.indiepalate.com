title: Chicken Lunch Wraps
---

I've been looking for a quick, easy, and healthy lunch. Unfortunately,
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches fill only two of those requirements
(especially when eaten daily). I've also been looking to up my greens
intake.

In the building I used to work in, they had an excellent deli that
served fresh sandwiches and wraps. For the longest time, I ate the club
sandwich. But, one day I decided to try their grilled chicken wrap, and
I was hooked.

So here's [a chicken lunch wrap recipe](.). It
requires a little prep, but the chicken can be made in large batches and
kept for a week. I went with cabbage, which has a different flavor.
I tried two variations: Ranch dressing (unhealthy) with cheddar, and
fat-free Italian dressing (healthy) with pepperjack, both to good
effect.

Here's to a week's worth of healthy lunches!

## Ingredients

* 2 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
* Cabbage, shredded
* Cheese
* Dressing
* Tortillas
* Salt
* Pepper

## Instructions

Remove excess fat from chicken and, if too large, split in half. Coat
liberally in salt and pepper. Heat pan over medium-high heat. Fry
chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Let cool.

Meanwhile, shred cabbage and grate cheese. When chicken is cool enough,
cut into cubes.

Warm tortillas in microwave. Build wraps by combining chicken, cabbage,
cheese, and dressing. Close wraps starting from the bottom, then the
sides, then rolling the bottom over the top.

The whole point of this for me is to get more vegetables in my diet.
Cabbage is good. Lettuce (of any variety) is also good.

First, remove any excess fat from the chicken. On the breasts, there
will be some fat on the edges, and likely some on the bottom as well.

Once that's done, we can split this in half. It's entirely too thick to
cook well in the pan.

Split the breast in half by cutting across with a chef's knife. This
will make it easier to cook through, and make it easier to cube later.

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and set aside.

To prepare our cabbage, first rinse off the outer leaves, removing any
damaged ones.

Now, we need to cut down through the stem of the cabbage, halving it.

Then we can cut both halves in half again, forming quarters.

Once we've got quarters, we can remove the stem.

With the stem removed, we can shred it.

Cut across the cabbage first, forming strips.

Then cut across the strips.

The cabbage can go in a zipper bag and should keep for a few days.

Now we can start cooking the chicken. Add a bit of oil to a pan over
medium heat, then add the chicken. We don't want to crowd the pan, so
cook the chicken in batches if necessary.

![Two bowls of shredded cheese](15-cheese-shredded.jpg)

While we wait for the chicken to cook, we can shred the cheese. Cheddar
is always good, but I also decided to try some pepperjack.

After a few minutes, we can flip the chicken.

Remember that browning means flavor. Try not to flip the chicken over
prematurely.

The chicken is done when its internal temperature reaches 165Â°. Once
done, remove it from heat to a plate to cool down a bit.

Once the chicken is cooled, you can cut it into cubes.

Some of these pieces aren't cooked through, especially those near the
bottom of the picture. I had to toss them back into the pan for a bit.

Now we've got everything ready and we can build our wrap.

![Chicken on a tortilla](22-wrap-chicken.jpg)

Start with a little bit of chicken.

![Cabbage and chicken on a tortilla](23-wrap-cabbage.jpg)

Then add a handful of cabbage.

![Cheese and cabbage and chicken on a tortilla](24-wrap-cheese.jpg)

This one has cheddar cheese.

![Dressing, cheese, cabbage, and chicken on a tortilla](25-wrap-dressing.jpg)

And finally, some Ranch dressing.

![Closed wrap on a plate](26-wrap-wrapped.jpg)

Close the wrap by folding up the bottom, then the sides, then rolling
the bottom over the top.

Feel free to mix it up. This one's made with pepperjack cheese and
Italian dressing (non-fat, for health purposes).
