Fresh blueberries were on sale, so I had a chance to get [the bad muffin experience]()
out of my head.

Not using liners works, but do let them cool 5-10 minutes in the pan. And do grease
the pan, and re-grease if making a second batch. Use a fork to get them off the side.

The streusel topping didn't quite turn out like I'd hoped. I like the one I made over
the [lemon coffee cake]() more.
