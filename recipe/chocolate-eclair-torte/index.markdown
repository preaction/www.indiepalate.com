title: Chocolate Eclair Torte
---

This is a simple, delicious dessert we used to have growing up. The only
issue is you have to let it sit overnight (a test of my willpower).

## Ingredients

### Filling

2 (3.5 oz.) boxes vanilla instant pudding
3 c. milk
8 oz. whipped cream, thawed
Graham crackers

### Chocolate Ganache

1/3 c. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 c. sugar
1/4 c. milk
1/2 c. butter
1 tsp. vanilla

## Instructions

Combine the pudding mix and milk and whisk together for 2 minutes, until
thickened. Add the whipped cream and combine well.

In a 13"x9" pan, lay down a layer of graham crackers. Spoon half the
pudding mixture on top of the graham crackers and smooth until even. Put
another layer of graham crackers on top of the layer of pudding. On top
of this, add another layer of pudding, and a final layer of graham
crackers. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, combine cocoa powder, sugar, and milk. Heat over
medium heat until boiling, stirring often. Let boil for about one
minute. Remove from heat, let cool for another minute, then add butter
and vanilla and stir until butter melts and is incorporated.

Pour chocolate over top layer of graham crackers and spread to cover.
Refrigerate overnight before serving.
