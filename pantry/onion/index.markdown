# Onions

Onions are an aromatic vegetable. The edible part is the bulb of the
allium family, which includes garlic, shallots, and leeks.

Onions come in different varieties:

* Yellow onions
* White onions
* Red onions
* Vidalia onions

# Purchase

When purchasing onions, make sure they're firm and the skin is rich
brown/orange. Avoid onions with dark spots. The outer layers of skin are
paper-thin and often flake off during shipping and handling, which is
fine.

# Storage

Store whole in a dark, cool, dry place, like a cellar or cupboard. Do not
store in the refrigerator.

Sliced onions can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for weeks in the
fridge, or months in the freezer.
