title: Cheese Gnocchi
---

A little bit goes a long way here. It's a good, deep, full feeling.

I always end up needing a lot more flour than the recipe says. If you run out of
flour (as I embarassingly did), instant potato flakes work well.

The dough should be soft, but not sticky.

## Ingredients

* 1 15oz container ricotta cheese
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 2 c flour (probably more)

## Instructions

In a medium bowl, whisk together cheese, egg, olive oil, and salt. Start adding
1 1/2 cups of the flour to the bowl and mix together. Add flour 1/4 at a time
until dough is no longer sticky.

Take a chunk off the dough and roll it out into a rope a little less than 1" in
diameter. Cut into 1/2" wide chunks and lay out on a cookie sheet. Press your
finger into the middle to create a dimple.

Cook immediately by placing into boiling water for a few minutes until gnocchi
rise to the surface. Alternatively, freeze for about an hour before placing
into airtight containers. To cook after freezing, drop frozen into boiling
water for a few minutes until gnocchi rise to the surface (exactly as for fresh
gnocchi).
