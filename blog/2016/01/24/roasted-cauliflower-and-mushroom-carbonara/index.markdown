title: Roasted Cauliflower and Mushroom Carbonara
---

Tonight I made [Roasted Cauliflower and Mushroom Carbonara from
closetcooking](http://www.closetcooking.com/2014/03/roasted-cauliflower-and-mushroom.html).

I'm trying to get more vegetables in my diet. So adding mushrooms and
cauliflower to a classic carbonara, instead of the Italian sausage,
sounded like a good idea.

And it was! It turned out really well, and came together easily, though
roasting the vegetables does make the whole thing take about 20-30
minutes.

This is making me curious: What other vegetables can I add to carbonera?
Asparagus perhaps? Broccoli maybe? I'm definitely going to need to
experiment here!
