title: Kettle Corn
---

Popcorn is the perfect snack food. It's inexpensive, low-calorie, and easy to
make. Adding a bunch of butter makes it a lot less healthy. Adding a little bit
of sugar, however, makes it delicious!

If you've got 15 minutes and a pan with a cover, you can make your own kettle
corn at home.

The key to light and not greasy kettle corn is to only just coat the bottom of the pan
in the oil. There should be about 1/8" of oil in the pan, not even half of the popcorn
kernel should be covered.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 c vegetable oil
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1/2 c popcorn
* Salt

## Instructions

Pour the oil in a large saucepan (with a cover). Add three popcorn kernels and turn
heat to medium. When the kernels pop, remove them, add the sugar and the rest of the
popcorn, and shake until the popping slows down. Turn off the heat and continue to
shake until the popping stops.

Pour the popcorn into a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Stir the popcorn until
cool to avoid clumping.

The sugar carmelizes at about the same temperature as the corn pops, so you
have to be careful. Make sure to prep all your ingredients beforehand. Mis√© en
place isn't just for professionals.

It's ready when those kernels pop (but be sure to remove them so they don't burn).
