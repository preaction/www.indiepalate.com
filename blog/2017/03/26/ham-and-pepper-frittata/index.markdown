title: Ham and Pepper Frittata
---

I used to do prep at the pizza place, and I can't believe it's taken me
this long to realize that chopped veggies can be stored overnight in
a fridge and used the next day (or even, gasp, two or three days later).

It's easy:

1. Buy an extra red pepper
2. Chop it up with the rest of the red peppers from [Chicken Paprikash](/blog/2017/03/20/chicken-paprikash/index.markdown)
3. Put the extra chopped peppers in a sealed container
4. Add to eggs and breakfast potatoes

Where I used to think that a Denver Omelette (ham, onion, bell pepper)
would be difficult to make for myself at home, now I realize that I can
make them as long as I'm willing to have 3-4 of them during the week. Or
I can make other things with the same ingredients, like add potatoes and
make a hash, or add a pie crust and make a quiche, or sub the ham for
some other meat and make tacos! Having pre-prepped veggies makes a lot
of things easy!
