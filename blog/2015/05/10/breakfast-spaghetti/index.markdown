title: Breakfast Spaghetti
---

I'm a big fan of Pasta Carbonara, which a friend of mine affectionately refers
to as "Breakfast Spaghetti". Raw egg is added to just-cooked spaghetti. The heat
from the spaghetti cooks the egg into a nice coating. Add parmesan cheese, Italian
sausage, and proscuitto (or bacon in a pinch) and you've got Carbonara!

Lacking the necessary Italian sausage, I decided to try something a bit
different. Instead of scrambling the egg, I fried it over-easy with salt,
pepper, and Italian seasoning. I cooked the bacon crispy, rather than my usual
chewy, and topped it with the cheese.

The fried egg turned out okay, but only just. After I added the egg to the
spaghetti, the spaghetti cooked the yolk through the rest of the way (exactly
like carbonara).  The bacon was good, but the cheese didn't appear to add
anything. And the absense of the sausage was felt... It needs some brighter
flavors, something sweet.

So I added some Sriracha! And it is delicious! I'm going to try it without the
italian seasoning, since Sriracha is so overpowering I suspect they are doing
nothing.

Here are all the ingredients for this endeavour. Italian seasoning blend is
awesome!

Start with the bacon. Frying eggs in bacon fat is tasty!

I decided to make the bacon crispier so I could crunch it into tiny bits of flavor,
but you can make it as chewy or crispy as you like.

Now that our pan is ready, we can make the eggs. Drain out most of the bacon fat,
leaving just a coating to help cook the eggs.

Here's where we add the spices!

I clearly have not fried any eggs in a long time, and my pan's nonstick coating
is now nonexistant.

And now all we need to do is combine it together!
