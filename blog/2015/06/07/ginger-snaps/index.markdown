title: Ginger Snaps
---

It's amazing how well the spices in these cookies work. Individually, the
spices are very strong flavors (smell them as you make these and you'll see).
Together with a bunch of sugar, it's a deliciously spicy cookie.

Like the [snickerdoodles](/blog/2015/05/03/snickerdoodles), these cookies require
a bit more work than [chocolate chip cookies](/blog/2015/04/19/chocolate-chip-cookies),
but they're worth it!

Like most of my cookie recipes, this comes from my classic Better Homes and Gardens
cookbook. There's a lot of stuff in here, I just never sat down and read it before.
Growing up, it was always "the cookie recipe book".

Shortening and butter can [basically be substituted one for the
other](http://www.thekitchn.com/shortening-vs-butter-in-cookies-whats-the-difference-213812).
But, butter has a lot more liquid inside, which can make the cookies crispier
as they bake, and butter melts at a lower temperature, which makes the cookies
spread out more. I tend to use a combination of butter and shortening, which is
a deviation from the original recipe.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c shortening
* 1 c butter
* 2 c sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 c molasses
* 4 tsp ground ginger
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground cloves
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 4 1/2 c flour
* 3/4 c sugar for coating

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°.

With a mixer, cream butter and shortening together for 30 seconds. Add sugar
and mix together, scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is
mixed. Mix in eggs and molasses and beat until smooth. Add ginger, cinnamon,
cloves, baking soda, and salt. Add the flour in 2-3 batches, mixing until
combined.

For sugar coating, put sugar on a plate or in a bowl. Roll dough into 1" balls,
and then roll in sugar. Place on cookie sheet, about 2" apart. Bake for 8-9
minutes, or until bottoms are lightly browned and tops are puffed and cracked.

Like most cookie recipes, start by creaming the fats together, incorporating some
air into the mix.

Next add the sugar, which is an honorary part of the liquid ingredients.

Now add the rest of the liquid.

For the dry ingredients, first add the spices.

Then add the flour in 2 batches.

Roll the dough into 1" balls, and then roll them in the sugar before dropping on to
baking sheets.

After 8-9 minutes, the top will look cracked, and the very bottoms will turn golden.
