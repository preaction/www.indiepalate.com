title: Chicken Parmesan
---

I've made this recipe a lot. It was one of the first real things I learned to
make. It's one of my favorite recipes: Easy, delicious, and filling. It
combines my favorite meat with my favorite pasta sauce. [Chicken
Parmesan](/recipe/chicken-parmesan) is the perfect chicken dish.

But I've always ever made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. In
my effort to also learn how to be cheap, and having some stuff to use up
from [last week's
tortellini](/blog/2016/04/27/tortellini-with-tomato-sauce/), I decided
to try making it with the bone-in, skin-on chicken thigh quarters I had
in the freezer.

It worked better than I expected. The chicken turned out great in the
oven, and [the tomato sauce](/recipe/tomato-sauce) worked well with
a little extra cooking time. I added some
[cauliflower](/pantry/cauliflower) to complete the meal.
