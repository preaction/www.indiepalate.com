title: Easy Slow Cooker BBQ Ribs
---

From America's Test Kitchen's Slow Cooker Revolution book.

They should re-evaluate what they mean by "easy", though after the [Italian Pot
Roast](), I guess this is easy by comparison. Slightly harder than the
[dry-rubbed oven spare ribs]() though, but the bonus here was I could start the slow
cooker before work, and come home to only a little more prep to do.

The result was nicely spicy. The ribs were fall off the bone tender.

The fat was hard to skim until I moved it to a taller, thinner container. Then I could
skim the fat with a spoon. Still need to figure out a good way for this.

The instructions suggest a rack to lift the ribs off the pan while broiling, but
it works pretty well without one. I probably would have cooked the sauce down a bit more,
and broiled the whole thing a bit less. The burnt bits on the pan were not tasty (the
rack would have solved that problem, but it's surmountable without one too).

Boiled corn on the cob and cheddar herb biscuits (recipe forthcoming) brought everything
together for a nice meal.
