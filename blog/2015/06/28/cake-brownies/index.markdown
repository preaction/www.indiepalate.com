title: Cake Brownies with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting
---

These are far more cake than brownies. The chocolate flavor is light, so you
absolutely need the frosting. I'm probably going to try a chocolate buttercreme
next time.

This isn't the first time I've made this, and they're tasty for what they are,
but they're not the kind of rich, chocolatey brownies I'm really craving right
now.

The glass 13x9 pan I used takes at least 30 minutes. I do not recommend using
glass bakeware for cakes...

## Ingredients

### Cake

* 3/4 c butter
* 1 1/4 c sugar
* 1/2 c unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 1/2 c flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 c milk
* 1 c chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

### Frosting

* 8 oz cream cheese
* 1 c semisweet chocolate chips
* 1/2 c powdered sugar
* Water, if needed

## Instructions

### Cake

Preheat oven to 350Â°.

Melt the butter. Combine melted butter, sugar, and cocoa powder in a bowl. Add eggs
and mix until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda and mix until
combined. Add milk and mix until smooth. Add nuts if desired.

Spread into 13x9 pan and bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out clean. Let cool for 2 hours before frosting.

### Frosting

In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and sugar.

In a medium saucepan, slowly heat chocolate chips until smooth. Pour in to cream
cheese and mix until smooth.

Spread over brownies.

The best part of these is that the ingredients are all pretty normal to have
around.

Spread it into a pan and bake.

Glassware takes a lot longer to bake, so be sure to use the toothpick to check
doneness.

It needs to cool for a couple hours, so wait for a bit before making the
frosting.

First, combine the non-chocolate ingredients.

We only need a cup of the chips, so save the rest for later (or eat them).

Melt the chocolate carefully over low heat, stirring constantly.

Then, add it to the rest, and mix together.

When completely mixed, new lights will turn on, to make your kitchen shine with
radience.

If you need to at this point, add some water to make this spreadable.
