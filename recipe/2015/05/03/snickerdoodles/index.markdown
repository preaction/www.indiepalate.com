Snickerdoodles: The gloriously simple cookie with the silly name. The
ingredient list is short, and all they require is a bit of chilling, a bit of
rolling (frolicking) in cinnamon and sugar, and pop them in the oven.

If you love vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar, you'll love these cookies.

Making cookies with a stand mixer is great. Creaming butter in a mixer is no
work at all. When the going gets tough at the end, the stand mixer barely
groans. If it weren't for my mixer, I would not make cookies as often as I do.

These cookies take a little more work, rolling them around in cinnamon-sugar,
but it's worth it. To make the most of out the work, I recommend doubling
the batch!

Fresh out of the oven they were a bit crunchy, but after being kept overnight
in a sealed container, they are perfectly chewy throughout.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c butter, softened (1 stick)
* 1 c sugar
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 1 1/2 c flour

### Coating

* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp cinnamon

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375Â°.

Cream butter in mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar, baking soda,
and cream of tartar, and mix until combined, scraping the side of the bowl to get
everything incorporated.

Add the egg and vanilla and combine well. Add flour in 2 batches, mixing completely.

Cover and chill dough in refridgerator for an hour.

Once chilled, combine the sugar and cinnamon for the coating on a plate or in a bowl.
Roll cookies into 1 inch balls, and roll in cinnamon-sugar until coated. Place 2 inches
apart on cookie sheet.

Bake for 10 minutes per batch, or until tops are cracked and edges are golden. Cool
completely on wire racks.

The best thing about these is how few ingredients they take. Except the cream
of tartar, which I assume has some other purpose than making snickerdoodles,
but I have not yet had the pleasure.

My favorite thing. My muse. I'm honestly starting to worry about how awesome
I find this thing.

The first step, creaming the butter. This incorporates some air into it, which makes
the end result puff up better.

Next, add the sugar and the leavenings (baking soda and cream of tartar). We add the
leavening early to ensure it gets well incorporated.

Then, add the liquid (eggs and vanilla). Mix well.

Once chilled, we can make the coating..
