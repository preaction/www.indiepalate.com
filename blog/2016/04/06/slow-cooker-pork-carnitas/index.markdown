title: Slow Cooker Pork Carnitas

Here's what happened to the rest of [last week's 10-lb pork
roast](/blog/2016/03/31/honey-balsamic-pulled-pork/): [slow cooker pork
carnitas](http://www.recipetineats.com/pork-carnitas-mexican-slow-cooker-pulled-pork/).

Just like before, this was incredibly easy.  After 3 hours, the pork was
cooked but still holding together. After 4 hours, it was tender enough
to shred. I substituted lemon juice for orange juice, because I had an
extra lemon on hand. I tried it without reducing the braising liquid,
and it was effectively tasteless.  Reduce the liquid to add the lovely
flavor back.

This worked well as soft tacos for almost a week. A bit of lettuce,
cheese, and sour cream turned it into something reminiscent of Taco
Bell, if they'd ever serve pork (and I mean that in the best possible
way).

All together, my experiment with a pork shoulder turned out great, and I'm
glad to have another thing to look out for when I'm perusing the local
grocery store.
