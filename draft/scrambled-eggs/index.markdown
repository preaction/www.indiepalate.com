Part of this blog is me making neat stuff, but most of it is me building
a knowledgebase of daily cooking. To that end, here's [everything I know
about making scrambled eggs](/pantry/egg/scrambled), which require a bit
of knowledge and practice to make perfect. I fall on the "add a bit of
milk" side of the controversy, but don't hold that against me. Either
way, the key is low heat and remembering not to overcook.

Like [the breakfast quesadilla](/blog/2016/07/21/breakfast-quesadilla/),
I added cheese, mushrooms, and onions to my eggs, to make things
interesting.
