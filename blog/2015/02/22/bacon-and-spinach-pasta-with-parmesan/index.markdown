title: Bacon and Spinach Pasta with Parmesan
---

Sometimes, I try new things. Sometimes, I listen to people describing how delicious
something is and I believe them. Sometimes I put a lot of work into making something
that turns out to be not really that good. Tonight was one of those times.

Spinach is not my favorite green (kale currently holds that spot). There is
something...  off... about the taste that reminds me of musty basements. But,
every once in a while I forget this, or I decide to give it another try. In
that light, this recipe isn't bad. If you like bacon and spinach, then this
recipe is great!

I was intrigued by using chicken stock to make the pasta, but it was great and left
a wonderful sauce. I might try this again with kale. I might also try making the
bacon a bit crispier, to increase the bacon flavor.

## Ingredients

* 12 oz. bacon
* 1/2 medium onion
* 4 c chicken broth
* 1 lb pasta
* 1/2 lb fresh spinach
* 2/3 c grated Parmesan

## Instructions

Dice the onion and slice the bacon into 1-inch strips.

In a large skillet, fry the bacon until the edges are crispy. Drain most of the fat
from the pan, leaving about a tablespoon, and then add the onion.

Saute the onion until it's transparent, then add the chicken broth. Scrape the bottom
of the pan to get the bacon flavor into the broth.

Add the pasta to the skillet, cover, and bring to a boil. Simmer until the liquid left
in the bottom of the pan is thick, about 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes.

Add the spinach to the pan (perhaps in batches), and stir until it has wilted. Turn
off the head, add the cheese, and serve.

It's always good to get everything measured and sliced before starting to cook
anything. Professionals call this ["mise en
place"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), French for "putting in
place".

The bacon will be easier to slice if it's just a little bit frozen still.

If you got a big bunch of spinach, slice off the stems. We mostly want the
leaves.

Bacon is great!

To keep the bacon from becoming crispy, I removed it. I think next time I'll
keep it in, like the instructions say...

When adding the broth, scrape the bottom of the pan to get all the bits of
bacon into the broth.

Cooking pasta in broth smells simply amazing.

When the pasta is done, the sauce will be thick enough to do this:

I had to add the spinach in batches, because there was so much of it.

Once the spinach is wilted, we can finish with the cheese.
