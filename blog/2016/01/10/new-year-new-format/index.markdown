title: 'New Year - New Format'
---

It's been just about a year since I started this blog, and as I hoped,
my skills have vastly improved. I'm cooking better, I'm eating better,
I'm saving money, and I'm learning a lot about food.

However, I haven't been posting nearly as much as I'd like. I think it's
mostly because creating an entire recipe post, with photos and
instructions, takes a few hours. Posting one of those a week has been
difficult, especially when it may be months since I actually made the
recipe.

I'd also like to talk about the things I'm doing today, not 4 months
from now. If I find a new recipe and try it out, I'd like to quickly
show it off, and invite you to try it yourself.

I'd also like to start collecting bits of food knowledge: When to buy
things for freshness and lowest cost, how to store them, how to cook
them, how to prepare them. So much food can be made without regard to
a recipe, just preparing a bunch of different foods and combining them
together. A nice egg scramble with mushrooms and onions doesn't require
a recipe, it requires cooking and knowledge that these things go
together.

So, I'm changing up the format of this blog a bit: The blog will contain
all the posts as I make them, with some new posts reporting on recipes
I find around the Internet. Full recipe writeups will still be produced,
but likely at a slower pace, and organized alphabetically. I also hope
to open a space for me to keep food knowledge soon, and I'll post
updates to those pages to the blog as they happen.

Here's to another productive year of cooking and learning!
