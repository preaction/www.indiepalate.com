A few months back I bought a 12 pound bag of chicken drumsticks, so I've
had lots of chicken recipes on my mind. When I came across [this
Jamaican Jerk Chicken Drumsticks
recipe](http://www.recipetineats.com/jamaican-jerk-chicken-drumsticks-with-caribbean-rice-with-beans/),
I had to give it a try: I wanted something spicy/sweet, and this
certainly does that.

I couldn't find Scotch Bonnet peppers, so I used Habanero peppers
instead. Pro tip: *Use gloves*. I barely touched the peppers, and my
fingers were on fire for hours afterward. I was thankfully lucky enough
to not touch any sensitive parts...

The recipe also includes rice and beans, but I decided to use up my
potatoes and make garlic mashed (with some cheese, because why not).
Side note: Life is too short to eat mild cheddar... Maybe one could find
use for it as part of a cheese tray with crackers. But, mild cheddar in
any other purpose else is easily overpowered.
