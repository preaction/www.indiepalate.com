title: Chocolate-Chip Cookies

Chocolate-chip cookies need no introductions. Chocolate-chip cookies need no
excuse.  All chocolate-chip cookies need is the standard baking staples, a
bowl, a couple hours, and the desire for soft, chewy, chocolately goodness.

The best possible advice I can give for making cookies is to get a mixer.
Either a stand mixer, like I use below, or a hand mixer. Making sure the
ingredients are well-mixed at every step is the key to good cookies.

Also, use room-temperature ingredients. The butter should be soft, and the eggs
should be out of the fridge for about an hour to warm up. The soft butter is
easier to cream, and the warmed eggs are easier to incorporate.

Since it is very easy to scale up, I tend to make double batches. It's almost
too much for my mixer, but more cookies is always better than fewer.

# Ingredients

* 1/2 c shortening
* 1/2 c butter, softened
* 1 c brown sugar
* 1/2 c sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 1/2 c flour
* 1 12oz package semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Instructions

Preheat oven to 375Â°.

First, mix the butter and shortening together on high for at least 30 seconds.
Add the brown sugar, sugar, and baking soda and mix until combined, making sure
to scrape the sides of the bowl.

Add the eggs and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add the flour slowly, in 2 or 3
batches until incorporated (the mixer may give up at the last batch, so break
out the strong arm).

Add the chocolate chips. Arrange tablespoon-sized drops of dough on cookie
sheet.  Bake for 8 minutes, or until the bottom edge of the cookie turns
slightly brown (top may still appear uncooked). Place on wire rack to cool.

This thing is perhaps the best tool for baking and mixing. It is powerful. It
will last forever.

It is important to get a lot of air into the butter, so do not skimp on the
mixing at this step.

Same thing with the sugar. The best results I've had are from mixing extremely
thoroughly.

Don't forget to keep scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is
incorporated!

At this point, only the Kitchenaid has the necessary torque to mix the final,
crucial ingredient.

A couple spoons makes it easy to drop the right-sized amount of dough onto the
cookie sheet.
