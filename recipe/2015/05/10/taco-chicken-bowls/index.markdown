Got a new crock pot, and this was the inaugural recipe! For the longest time, I had
a very bad crock pot. It was small, and the cooking surface wasn't removable, making
even simple things a lot harder than necessary.

So, since I really wanted to try [this Taco Chicken Bowls recipe from Budget
Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2011/07/taco-chicken-bowls/), and a bunch of
other recipes in America's Test Kitchen's Slow-Cooker Revolution books, I bought
myself a new slow-cooker.

This recipe is great because it comes together with almost no work. No browning,
no pre-cooking. Just trim the chicken, toss everything into the pot, set it and
forget it.

I am amazed at how well the chicken turned out. Was definitely a good idea to
go for the thigh meat. A little chicken went a long way here.

I doubled the corn, because that was the size of the frozen corn package I had.
Next time, I'm going to double the beans too.

Though I made bowls as directed, this would probably go just as well wrapped in
a tortilla with some sour cream.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb boneless chicken
    * I went with thighs, but any boneless cut will do
* 1 16 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 12 oz frozen corn
* 1 16 oz jar salsa
* White rice (1/2 c dry per bowl)
* Cheddar cheese

### Spices

* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 tbsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions

Trim any excess fat away from the chicken. Add chicken, beans, corn, salsa, and spices
to the slow cooker. Cook for 6-8 hours on low. When done, shred the chicken with a fork.

15 minutes before the chicken is done, cook the rice (it'll take about 15 minutes).
Put the rice on the bottom of the bowl. Add the chicken mixture on top. Garnish with
cheese.

There are a lot of spices here, but they're worth it to have on-hand.

Clean the fat away from the chicken. If you don't, it'll turn rubbery and gross
in the crock pot.

Then just add it all to the pot!

Cover and cook.

Just before the chicken is done, make the rice. You'll want about 1/2 cup of dry
rice for each bowl. 1/2 cup of dry rice requires 1 cup of water to cook.

Bring the water to a boil.

Then, add the rice.

Cover and bring back to a boil. When it's boiling, reduce heat to low.

When all the liquid is absorbed, the rice is done.

Fluff it with a fork and let it sit uncovered for a few minutes.

After 6-8 hours, the chicken is all done!

Shred the chicken with a fork.

To make the bowls, start with some rice.

Add some chicken on top.

And garnish with the cheese!

The cheese is optional, and I completely forgot it the first time. But it does
become infinitely more delicious with the cheese!
