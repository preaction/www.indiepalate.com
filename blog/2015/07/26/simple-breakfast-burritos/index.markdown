title: Simple Breakfast Burritos
---

After [Oven Chicken Fajitas](/blog/2015/07/19/oven-chicken-fajitas), I had
some extra tortillas laying around. A common problem, with a satisfying
solution: Breakfast burritos!

This time, I decided to add some Sriracha to the mix. It turned out
surprisingly well, though it was a bit of a flavor shock. Taco sauce or pico de
gallo might have been less weird.

The best thing about tortillas is you can basically put anything inside them. Even
mac and cheese and hot dogs (which is delicious, by the way). Apple pie filling and
cheddar cheese make a good quesadilla. And all sorts of other fun things.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp butter
* 4 eggs (1 per tortilla/serving)
* 1 c (uncooked) rice (1/4 c per tortilla)
* 2 c water (twice as much as the rice)
* 1/4 c milk
* salt
* pepper
* Sriracha sauce
* Shredded cheese

## Instructions

In a medium saucepan with a cover, start boiling the water for the rice. When
the water comes to a boil, add the rice, bring back to a boil, and reduce heat
to low to let simmer for about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, scramble the eggs in a bowl, and then add the milk. Melt the butter
in a skillet over low heat. When the butter is melted, add the eggs. Add
some salt and pepper, and stir until firm but still a bit glossy.

The rice is done when all of the water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork, and let
sit for another minute or two.

Warm up the tortilla in a microwave for 10-20 seconds. Combine rice, egg,
sriracha, and shredded cheese. Close the tortilla by folding up from the
bottom, then fold in the sides, and finish by rolling upwards.

One of the two major benefits to knowing how to cook is being able to improvise
out of what's in the kitchen (the other is being able to improvise out of
what's on sale at the store).

![Butter in the pan](2-butter.jpg)

You can start the butter in the pan on low while you mix up the eggs.

![Cracked eggs](3-eggs.jpg)

Crack the eggs into a bowl.

And then whip them together with a fork using a folding motion.

![Add milk](5-eggs-milked.jpg)

A bit of milk adds some creaminess (though this may be cargo-cult knowledge,
and I need to try without it)

![Butter ready](6-butter-melted.jpg)

Now the butter is ready.

![Add the eggs](7-eggs-in-the-pan.jpg)

So we can add the eggs.

![Eggs frying](8-eggs-frying.jpg)

Keep the heat on low, and keep stirring to cook the eggs evenly.

![Add salt and pepper](10-add-salt-and-pepper.jpg)

Near the end of the cooking, while the eggs still look moist, add the salt and pepper.

![Eggs done](11-eggs-done.jpg)

The eggs are done when they're firm, but still look a bit wet. They'll continue
to cook a bit in their own heat, so if they look dry, they're overdone.

![A tortilla](12-warm-tortilla.jpg)

Warm the tortilla up in the microwave for 10-20 seconds to make it pliable.

![Some rice](13-rice.jpg)

Add some rice

![Some eggs](14-egg.jpg)

Add some eggs

![Some Sriracha](15-sriracha.jpg)

Spice it up with some Sriracha

![Some cheese](16-cheese.jpg)

And finish it off with some cheese

![Wrapped up](17-wrapped-up.jpg)

Wrap up the burrito by folding the bottom up, then the sides in, then rolling the
bottom over the top.

And enjoy!
