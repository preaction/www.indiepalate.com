cheese](/blog/2015/04/12/cheddar-cheese-sauce/) [on this
site](/blog/2016/04/20/southwest-chicken-mac-and-cheese/), I love Mac and
Cheese. My current favorite recipe is my [Cheddar Cheese
Sauce](/blog/2015/07/12/cheddar-cheese-sauce-revisited/), which is quickly
built from a standard b√©chamel (milk sauce). But though practice makes perfect,
and the skills needed to make the sauce are transferable to dozens or hundreds
of applications, I'm always on the look-out for new recipes to try.

So, a few weeks ago, [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com) [The Food
Lab](http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab) posted [this recipe for
3-ingredient, stove-top Mac and
Cheese](http://www.seriouseats.com/2017/01/the-food-lab-3-ingredient-fast-easy-stovetop-macaroni-and-cheese.html).
The three ingredients are: Macaroni elbow noodles, evaporated milk, cheese. It
takes around 10 minutes. It's incredibly simple. It's wonderfully delicious.
While this may not end up as my go-to recipe, it's certainly one of the best
recipes I've tried.

After a taste test as-is, I decided to add some bacon and chipotle peppers to
spice things up a bit. The smokey, chili goodness of real peppers is so much
better than the chipotle spice I got from Penzie's (not knocking Penzie's,
their spice is still amazing, but it can't compare to the smooth richness of
the real deal).
