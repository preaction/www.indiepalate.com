I've been on [Imgur](http://imgur.com) for a couple years now
([preaction on Imgur](http://preaction.imgur.com). In between the cat
pictures, gratutitous memes, and the occasional racist/sexist
circle-jerk, there are sometimes a food recipe or two (so, just like
every other Internet community).

I've seen a few recipes for Zuppa Toscana, but I decided to actually try
[this recipe for Zuppa Toscana I found on
Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/OoOrh9O). It's made with potatoes,
bacon, Italian sausage, and kale, with chicken stock and cream for
a base. It's a good, hearty soup with plenty of flavor, though it does
take about an hour to make.
