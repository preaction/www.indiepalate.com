title: Southwest Chicken Mac and Cheese
---

Okay, just stick with me on this one.

In my late teens and early twenties, a lot of the food I ate came from
cans and boxes, as I imagine most 20-somethings working shitty
manufacturing jobs that paid enough to eat better than ramen noodle soup
(those poor, lazy college kids). When I remembered, I'd pick up bags of
frozen veggies, because I needed to offset the unhealthy with something
resembling actual food. This healthy food I would, of course, offset
with the cheapest macaroni and cheese I could find (no high-class Kraft
Dinner for us, no sir).

As I imagine most of us have done at one time or another (I'm talking to
you, [KFC Famous Bowl](https://www.kfc.com/menu/classics/famous-bowl)),
one day I got the fantastic idea to combine them, and my own personal
[Bachelor Chow (Now With
Flavor)](http://theinfosphere.org/Bachelor_Chow) was born: Canned tuna,
broccoli normandy, and macaroni and cheese.

This is not that recipe, but it belongs to the same dumb kid, 15 years
later.

This recipe calls for a can, yes, of chicken. If you're not feeling that
adventurous, or that lazy, you can boil and shred or pan-fry some
chicken breast. The pan-fry method will probably result in the most
flavor, especially when you get some nice browning.

Yes, I really went through with explaining this. But make no mistake:
You read it. Neither of us is innocent here.
