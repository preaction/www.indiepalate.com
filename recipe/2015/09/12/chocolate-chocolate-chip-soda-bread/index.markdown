title: Chocolate Chocolate Chip Soda Bread
---

On the back of the [Oats and Honey Soda Bread
recipe](/recipe/2015/08/30/oats-and-honey-soda-bread/), I decided to
make a sweeter, chocolate chocolate-chip soda bread. For only my second
time making bread, it was fantastic!

Soda breads are named such because their leavening, what makes them
rise, is baking soda (and not yeast). This makes soda breads easy and
quick to make, which is also why they can be referred to as quick
breads.

Like the previous soda bread, I found this [chocolate chocolate chip soda
bread recipe on bakingbites.com](http://bakingbites.com/2013/03/chocolate-chocolate-chip-irish-soda-bread/).
There are a few other varieties there that I think I'm going to try
someday...

# Ingredients

* 2 1/2 c all purpose flour
* 2 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1 1/4 c buttermilk
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 c chocolate chips

# Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, stir together the dry ingredients: Flour, cocoa powder,
baking soda, salt, and sugar. Next, add the butermilk and vanilla, and stir
until dough forms a ball. Dough should be only slightly sticky, so add
more flour if it's too sticky, or more buttermilk if it's too dry.

Add the chocolate chips and knead the dough for a few minutes. Place on
baking sheet, and flatten a little. Cut a large "X" into the top of the
dough, about 1/2" deep.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until the top of the loaf is slightly browned
and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely
on a wire rack.

Lot of common ingredients here. Bread is always just a few minutes away!

![](01-ingredients.jpg)

Prepare a baking sheet with some parchment paper. The bread won't stick
to it, or the pan.

Measure out the liquid ingredients for later.

Add all the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl. The flour.

The cocoa.

The baking soda.

The salt.

And the sugar.

Combine the dry ingredients so everything's evenly distributed.

Then add the wet ingredients and mix.

Tried using the mixer this time, so it was a bit less messy. I left the
dough sticky to see what would happen. I think I should have instead
added 2 tbsp more flour.

After a while, a ball will be formed.

Finally, add the chocolate chips. The recipe called for mini chocolate
chips, but I used regular chips. I was going to chop them up in the food
processor, but decided I'd just try it and see what happened.

Break out the dough hook and knead for a few minutes. I've heard 10-15
minutes, but I only did 4 this time. I'm going to have to try more
later.

Here, the dough is sticking to the hook. You can coat the hook with some
oil to fix this problem.

Now form the dough into a ball.

![](15-not-a-ball.jpg)

And place the ball on the pan.

Cutting a cross in the top helps control how the bread's shape changes
as it bakes. [See this article on scoring from The Fresh Loaf for more
information](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/handbook/scoring).

Last time, I waited until the specified time, and the loaf was a bit
dry. This time, I started checking at 37 minutes (with a recommended
bake time of 45 minutes). The toothpick test passed, and I took it out.
The crust was golden brown already, so I had a good feeling it was done.

![](18-oven.jpg)

It's ugly, yes. I've got a lot of practice to go to get this right.
Thankfully, it's still delicious.

Cool on a wire rack.

This time, it turned out nice and moist. Though, having chocolate chips
in the loaf changes things, and it was altogether a larger loaf. Really,
it might have been a bit underdone. I have not made enough bread to be
able to judge one way or the other. But, I liked it, and that's really
all that matters, right?

![](21-sliced.jpg)
![](22-crumb-close.jpg)

It turned out great, though having all the chips in the crust of the
bread made it difficult to slice without getting my hands all
chocolately (a problem that solves itself, really, as chocolate is
delicious).
