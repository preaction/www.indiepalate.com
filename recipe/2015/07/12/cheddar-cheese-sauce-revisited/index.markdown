title: Cheddar Cheese Sauce Revisited
---

I finally found the cheddar cheese sauce I was looking for, and it all started
with an unfortunate mistake. So, unlike most recipes, this one starts with a
story.

When cleaning out my fridge from [the Alfredo
sauce](/recipe/2015/05/17/spinach-and-mushroom-alfredo), I had some leftover
cheese to use up. But I only had half the amount of milk I needed. Being the
frugal type, I tossed it all together anyway.

The result was the alfredo sauce I had been looking for. The mistake I made was
that I didn't measure it, and I didn't write it down. Remember: The difference
between science and just fucking around is measuring, and writing it down.

So, I have no idea how much parmesan and romano cheese actually went into that
sauce, as well as how much garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and
a how big a sprinkle of nutmeg. That sauce is never to be duplicated, though it
may, in time, be imitated.

However, it did give me an idea to revisit the cheddar cheese sauce. My eyeball
estimate was that I had doubled the ratio of cheese in the alfredo sauce, and I
needed to see what that did to the cheddar sauce.

I was not disappointed.

Here, now, is the new recipe. The old recipe will be stricken from my
repertoire, though I may leave it up on the blog as a warning to others of what
happens when you strictly follow the straight and narrow recipe right to hell.

You want cheese? Here's the cheese.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1 c milk
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 2 c shredded cheddar cheese

## Instructions

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter. When the butter is melted, add the flour
and mix together. Heat slowly until it turns slightly ligher and smells nutty.
Add milk and whisk thoroughly. Add salt and pepper. Heat and stir until
thickened, and then add the cheese. Stir until melted.

Measure things out before you start, because things go quickly.

Then add the flour and whisk together.

Heat until it turns a bit lighter. Don't let it start turning darker, that's
for gravy.

The roux here you can see is a bit drier than I might like. It means I needed less
flour.

Add the milk and whisk together.

Add the salt and pepper, and keep whisking until the sauce is thickened.

Add the cheese and change to a spoon to stir. Using a whisk here will be
extremely hard to clean.

The cheese isn't quite emulsified. I could add some egg yolk to make it smoother,
or apparently I could try dry mustard...
