I had a craving for some french toast, so I adapted [Alton Brown's French Toast
recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/french-toast-recipe.html)
a bit to make a quick(ish) morning meal for one: I halved the recipe, left the
bread out in the air for about an hour, let it soak up the custard for about a
minute, and cooked on the stove over low heat for about 5 minutes. The result
was 3 pieces of dense, creamy goodness that I can't wait to try again!
