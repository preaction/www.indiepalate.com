Breakfast is my favorite meal, so it's a shame I don't write about it
much. Except for some [breakfast
burritos](/blog/2015/07/26/simple-breakfast-burritos), some [other
breakfast burritos](/blog/2016/06/16/breakfast-burritos), and an
experiment I called [breakfast
spaghetti](/blog/2015/05/10/breakfast-spaghetti), this blog has been
mostly lunch and dinner affairs.

So today, here's two breakfast classics: [how to make an
omelette](/pantry/egg/omelette) and [how to make
hashbrowns](/pantry/potato/hashbrowns). Got a couple eggs, some cheese,
and a potato laying around? Great! Maybe a couple mushrooms or a bit of
onion from a meal this week? Even better!
